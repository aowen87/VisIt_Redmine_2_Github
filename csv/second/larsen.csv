2934,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,Low,vtkMultiBlock has incorrect extents with some ImageData vti files,Matt Larsen,"",2.13.1,Matt Larsen,10/12/2017,"",100,"",10/12/2017 02:21 pm,03/05/2018 01:20 pm,2 - Rare,2 - Minor Irritation,2.12.3,"","",All,Any,"I investigated the visit avtVTKFileReader class and I identified the problem. VisIt expects the file containing the descriptions of all the blocks in each time step to have the extents for each block, when this information can also ( I think always )  be contained in the .vti file.  Before converting the data set to a rectilinear grid, I check if the extent VisIt uses is NULL and I ask the dataset what its extents are. This fixes the problem.
 
This is mainly a reminder to pull the fix of my branch and put it in the trunk."
2854,Resolved,VisIt,Feature,High,Return multiple pick results,Matt Larsen,"",2.13.0,Matt Larsen,06/27/2017,"",0,"",06/27/2017 06:08 pm,09/07/2017 05:09 pm,"","",2.12.1,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"We already support picking multiple elements through a single call, however, only the last pick result is returned through the python interface. GrizIt would like to be able to make a single call and get of list of dictionary results with the pick data for all picks."
2691,Pending,VisIt,Feature,High,Enhancements to reflection operator,Matt Larsen,"",3.0,Matt Larsen,10/18/2016,"",0,"",10/18/2016 05:20 pm,10/17/2017 07:49 pm,"","",2.12.3,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,GrizIt,"There is a request for enhancements to the reflection operator to better support GrizIt. The are two distinct but related features:
1) Reflect about an arbitrary plane defined by a point and a normal vector. This is currently possible to accomplish using a user created matrix and the transform operator, however, this requires additional plots for every reflection.
2) Two modes for reflection"" cumulative and non-cumulative. Cumulative is the way VisIt currently does reflections. Non-cumulative would only reflect the original mesh. I attached an image that visually demonstrates the disctinction."
3157,Pending,VisIt,Bug,Normal,XRay query does not check near and far planes,Matt Larsen,"",2.13.3,Matt Larsen,06/12/2018,"",0,"",06/12/2018 11:22 am,06/26/2018 06:59 pm,3 - Occasional,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,2.12.3,"","",All,Any,"The xray query is not respecting near and far planes. If you place the source and the detector way in front of the object, rays pass through the detector and hit the object anyway. This should not produce any image or result. This happens as well if the detector is placed inside the object."
2855,Resolved,VisIt,Feature,High,Add ability to remove a single pick instead of clearing all,Matt Larsen,"","",Matt Larsen,06/27/2017,"",0,"",06/27/2017 06:18 pm,03/05/2018 01:28 pm,"","",trunk,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,GrizIt,"Currently, we only have the ability to clear all picks. GrizIt supports creating an on-screen selection that highlights selected nodes / zones. For example to remove a single element, they are currently maintaining bookkeeping on their end so they can clear all picks, then re-pick all elements except the element they want remove.

Proposed solution is to create a new method that uses the pick designator (letter) as a unique identifier to locate and remove the pick actor / tab from the UI."

I don't know what they do."
