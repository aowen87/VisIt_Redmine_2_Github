3080,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,Normal,blueprint plugin succeeding in opening .root (silo) files and then segv'ing the mdserver,Cyrus Harrison,"",2.13.2,Mark Miller,05/01/2018,"",0,"",05/01/2018 08:38 pm,06/12/2018 12:23 pm,4 - Common,5 - Very Serious,2.12.3,"","",All,Any,"This is happening for Jeff Greenough.

Jeff's .root file is a Silo/HDF5 root file for a multi-part Silo file. But, Blueprint plugin is opening the file and and then seg'ving later on in mdserver.

You can re-produce by running the test data producer, multidir, as 
<pre>
./multidir -driver DB_HDF5
</pre>
Then, start VisIt, open multidir_test_data/*.root from within GUI and it will appear to hang as the mdserver cores and restarts a few times.

3146,Resolved,VisIt,Feature,Normal,Handle multi-block curve objects in VisIt internals,Mark Miller,"",2.13.2,Mark Miller,05/22/2018,"",0,4.0,05/22/2018 03:44 pm,06/12/2018 11:53 am,"","",2.12.3,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"A user defined a curve in a Silo file using multi-block 1D quad meshes but then couldn't plot them as curves.

VisIt has logic to detect 1D quadmeshes and re-interpret them as curves. However, it requires the quadmeshes also be single block.

By removing that logic and allowing a avtCurveMetaData to haven blocks, I've tested this and it works with very minor changes to VisIt internals.

The curve plot behaves strangely when domains are removed in the middle because it winds up connecting the dots across gaps in the curve that would otherwise exist due to domain removal. Removing domains from the ""ends"" of the curve plot works fine.

What should a subset plot of a multi-block curve look like? One idea I had was a banded colored background of the curve plot or a horizontally colored line.

Supporting a multi-block curve object simplifies data producers whose curve data is distributed across multiple MPI ranks.

OTOH, it is very apparent that ""curves"" should not demand as much special handling in Visit as we have for them and we'd be much better off just dealing with them like any other (rectilinear) qualmish except that they are 1D topologically and spatially. If we wound up modifying VisIt everywhere to do that, then this simple fix for curves is not necessary."

A file to demonstrate the issues is attached.

I opened it with with ProteinDatabank plugin and it opened successfully and showed several menu objects. It then allowed me to attempt to plot one and then produced the plot yielded no data message.

The problem is that the plugin summarily populates database metadata without regard for whether the file open actually succeeded. If it conditioned the population of metadata on a successful file open, then it could return _empty_ metadata in cases where the file is not a ProtienDatabank file and VisIt would recognize that the plugin is probably not the right one to use for the given file (even though the extensions matched).

Next, even a GetMesh call succeeds and returns NULL from this plugin.

This behavior had us convinced the file was indeed a ProteinDatabank file even though later analysis proved that it wasn't.

The solution was to add --no-openssl to Qt build. But, we don't wanna do that in general. Only when its absolutely necessary. This is because SeedMe needs it. Currently, SeedMe is not a bonafied build_visit package and is instead a sub-package in python build. So, build_visit really has no knowledge about whether it is or is NOT being requested in a build. So, there is no way to condition --no-openssl in Qt on basis of SeedMe. When python packages are promoted to fully first class packages in build_visit, then we could do business that way.

The solution here may be to just add an env. variable such as DO_QT_OPENSSL that a build_visit invoker can set to control this.

Below is the patch that our users came up with to bv_qt.sh to get things to build on Fedora.

Note that a key part of Engineering users interaction with VisIt is through a python script they have developed called _GrizIt_. The python _GrizIt_ script is designed to allow engineering users to use Griz commands they are familiar with to interact with VisIt.

VisIt's notion of _global_ node and zone ids is confined to a 1-tuple of arbitrary (but typically 32 or 64 bit integral) type. We need to generalize this notion to an n-tuple of arbitrary types. In the conext of Mili, _n_ would be 2. The first component would be a Mili class id, super class or class name (as strings) and the second component would be the number of the element in that collection.

Note that this impacts several spots in the GUI where users have the option of typing in _global_ ids. My suggestion, to make this modification simple, is to simply enhance these text box entries to support space, comma, semicolon and tab delimited values. The first value would be interpreted as the first component of the n-tuple, the 2nd value for the second component, etc. Finally, searches within mesh datastructures to find the node/zone specified by the n-tuple also would need to be enhanced to deal with multi-component matching.

Its concievable that one might want a 2-tuple consisting of a 'char' for the first component and an 'int' for the second. If that proves to be problematic however, its probably ok to assume all components of the n-tuple are the same type."

We may want to maintan a stack of recently entered pick strings that represents each group of picks and which can be easily toggled on/off or deleted. On the other hand, a simple toggle may be sufficient here to turn on and off picked/selected nodes/zones.

We wrote this plugin years ago in an attempt to integrate data from one of our solvers with VisIt.  Since then we have significantly expanded our suite of solvers (and added new data formats), and have standardized on another approach to VisIt interoperability.  We instead translate all of our data to VTK unstructured grids before sending data to VisIt.

We no longer use or maintain the VCellMTMD plugin.  Sorry, I should have informed you earlier so you don't waste time maintaining VCellMTMD.

We have also embraced the VisIt/pyside integration and deploy our VisIt capability as a QT application launched from VCell.​  This capability is currently pre-release quality, but we plan to bring it to production soon.  As you likely know, Kathleen resolved our inquiry about pyside support in Windows by including a fix in VisIt 2.12.1.  This worked for our VisIt/pyside application in WIndows 7 but still crashes under Windows 10.  I had promised Kathleen that I would create a simplified python script which would either illustrate the problem in VisIt (or reveal our own mistakes).

2355,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,Normal,XDMF reader confusing attributes with same dim as mesh as arrays,Kathleen Biagas,"",2.12.3,Mark Miller,08/12/2015,"",100,1.0,08/12/2015 02:08 pm,06/13/2017 02:01 pm,2 - Rare,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,2.8.2,"","",All,Any,"Quote Modify  Hi all,



I have been working on implementing HDF5 with XDMF as the new I/O for the code I use. I believe I have came across a bug in the VisIt XDMF Plug-in but I could be wrong.



Whenever a dimension of the data in the attribute matches the last dimension of the mesh in the grid it is on, VisIt views the attribute as an array. As an example, I have recreated the issue using explicit values given in XML, however this is the same issue as when I point to HDF5 datasets. In the below example (attached as well) the Attribute ""U"" is seen as an array in VisIt, since the last dimension of the mesh grid it is on, 9, is also a dimension of the Attribute. When this dimension matching does not occur however, everything works as expected, as in for the ""V"" attribute. 



I believe this is an issue in the VisIt plug-in because I could not cause this issue in p*r*view. I have used VisIt 2.9 and VisIt 2.7 and the same issue was present. If anyone has encountered this issue before or has an idea how to fix it, it would be greatly appreciated. Below is the example XDMF file that causes the error and the file information from VisIt.

This will load a database with about 3500 mesh objects each with 5-15 variables defined.
The GUI (and pan/zoom ops in the Viewer) can exhibit 10-20 second delays between adding plot and having it appear in the plot list, deleting a plot, hiding a plot, etc.

The shear number of items is part of the problem. Reducing the number of items can be improved somewhat...
* don't do automatic expresions (mesh quality, time derivative, vector magnitude). There are prefs. for these.
** Note: mesh quality exprs only get created for ucd meshes so that pref. has no effect on non-ucd mesh databases
* don't do operator-created expressions
** currently know pref. for this so need to add one
** We could adjust logic in operators to create operator exprs only when mesh or var count is low, say less than 50
* don't create subset plot entries for meshes of just one block. Thats pointless and easily corrected.
* We populate the menu in the viewer too. Do we really need to do that? An informal survey indicated several _developers_ weren't even aware of the option in the viewer's menu suggesting users are even less aware of this feature. I think it would be easiest/best to remove it entirely. Short of that, maybe it is never created until some user actually does the GUI actions to suggest its needed by right-clicking in the viewer, going to Plots and then trying to add a plot.

The above changes actually make things almost useable for seseame.pdb (an extreme example of a database with a large number of objects)

Next, we need to add smarts to not constantly create and destroy variable menus as frequently as we currently do. We enter VariableMenuPopulator a lot. It has some smarts to return early but I think we need to improve that. I think we should return early when the database and timestep are same since last visit. But, I don't think we do that. Furthermore, some of the logic there to determine early return is expensive (operator== on expression list iterates over all expressions). The order in which we consider each expression's members in an individual expression's operator== could have some impact too. For example, we should try to compare those attributes of expressions that are more likely to be different *first*. The operator[] on ExpressionList is a linear search. That can be fixed easily too. I've currently coded a simple hashing mechanism there and improved performance quite a bit.

We're also taking too much memory. The GUI process easily reaches 1 Gigabyte on sesame.pdb. Hacks for several of the obove changes demonstrate we can get that back down to something reasonable, maybe 250 Mb. However, I think the right long term answer is to switch to an on-demand form of menu creation where we keep a sort of dom object internally regarding what the full menu structure should look like but only realize the parts of that structure with the Qt widgets that are needed at any moment.

I rated impact as high but expected use as rare because I think it is rare we deal with databases with large numbers of objects."

The current eigenvector expression returns the vectors in a matrix, with individual eigenvectors in each column. This makes plotting the individual vectors using the [] operator incorrect…and inconsistent with visit documentation. You would have to take the transpose of the result from the eigenvector function, and then use the [] operator on the transpose. Does the visit team think that this is a problem?
If so, is this going to be fixed?

Likewise, VisIt knows about parallel and serial database engine targets. But, it doesn't know about parallel and serial TPL dependencies (at least I don't think it does).

A lot of other things can depend on HDF5 (netcdf, H5Part, Xdmf, etc., + many VisIt plugins). Can we get by with a single libhdf5.so installation that supports *both* serial and parallel (certainly, the HDF5 library is capable of that) or do we have to build two separate HDF5 installations, one with and the other without MPI dependence? Same question for libMOAB.

Or, do we need to build serial and parallel HDF5 installations and serial and parallel MOAB installations to handle this.

This has to do with VisIt's handling of time varying metadata. By default, it assumes md is time INvariant. So, objects that appear and disappear in Silo files in a sequence present problems.

The solution is to sometimes write empty objects so that the objects are always there and just sometimes empty.

There are some issues I guess with this type because it is an _optional_ part of the C9X types. That is, a system that is C9X compliant is not actually *required* to define the type. It may be defined. It may not me.

If we use conditional compilation logic to handle it, I would suggest we predicate that logic on whatever CMake provides for this. But, I don't know for sure if CMake handles it out of the box.

We currently use boost's cstdint.hpp header file that is in our third_party_builtin dir and I am not sure if that is the right way to handle it. First, it smears 'boost' references all over our code and I am not sure that is ok. I think cstdint.h header defines it too. I think <cstdint> defines it too but my OSX 10.8 system didn't have that header.

Various database plugins (and some others) have a dependency on Boost only because fixed size integer types such as “uint_32t” and “int8_t.” I believe we use boost/cstdint.hpp for that purpose mainly because Windows does not have a “stdint.h” in which these types are defined (both Linux and MacOS have that include file). Can we add a VisIt include file such as “VisItIntTypes.h” or similar that defines these types in a platform independent way? That way we could use that file instead of boost and make a large number of plugins independent of Boost.

I investigated this a bit more here at LBL talking to the BoxLib developers. There are different BoxLib file types, differentiated by the first line in “Header”. Most of the BoxLib files that I encountered are of type “HyperCLaw"" and that seems to be the type that VisIt expects. Andy Nonaka at CCSE has a copy of one of the files Mark Converse sent him. This is a file of type “CartGrid”, which seems to have additional information in it. VisIt completely ignores the first line of the file with the type. I assume when we were developing the reader in the first place, we did not have any access to “CartGrid” files so it did not make any difference.

However, if we want to read other BoxLib file types correctly, we need to read the first line and check the file type. The main difference between “HyperCLaw” and “CartGrid” files seems to be that they contain a “vfEps” (1e-08 in your file) per level between dx (the line ""0.05 0.05 0.05” in your file) and coordSys (the line “0” following the “1e-8” in your file). Removing this line (or these lines if there is more than one level), should allow VisIt to read the file until the reader is modified.

I think  I am now having the same problems you were having (even after removing that line with the 1e-08).  I tried it on my laptop locally (so here in the office) and it also doesn’t work.  I even took it home to try while vpn from a remote location and it doesn’t work.  I have no idea why it was working last week and doesn’t work this week.  Any thoughts?
  
Thanks,
Mark

Mark,
  
I removed that line as well, and I can open in Visit, then do a psuedocolor plot and draw a plot of that variable.  So at first blush it seems to be working.

Hi Mark,
  
I have debugged a bit more. IMHO, the problem is definitely with the Header file. The relevant section is below. . .
  
-2 -2 -2
2 2 2
  
((0,0,0) (79,79,79) (0,0,0))
100
0.05 0.05 0.05
1e-08
0
0
0 75 5.57623875809867e-06
100
  
Note the '1e-08' line.
  
VisIt's current plugin is expecting an integer there for the 'coordSys' data member of the Boxlib3D plugin. It reads as far as the '1' and sets coordSys int to 1. Then it attempts to read what it thinks is another 'integer' which I think is indicating if ghost zones are used. It tries to read the 'e-08' part via >> operator and that operation fails (i assume) or somehow the 'integer' value that gets set is '3'.
  
If I take out the 1e-08 line, neither boxlib nor VisIt crash anymore. However, I still don't get to a state where I can plot anything. The mdserver belives there are 75 blocks and a bunch of variables but VisIt's GUI menus are non-responsive.
  
I think somehow we're dealing with different file format versions.

Turns out at least one customer wants duplicate nodes to handle discontinuous nodal fields.

Whats the right answer here. Allowing duplicate nodes for purposes of discontinuous nodal fields is a huge overkill and hurts VisIt performance internally immensely. It would be better if we allowed for discontinuous nodal fields. We could do this implicitly by adjusting logic checking for mesh node count and variable tuple counts and if they are not equal but the field's count is such that it is indicate of having a value as though each cell has its own unique (duplicate) nodes, then we can handle and render it as a discontinuous field.

Or, we can consider a different type of centering AVT_NODE_CENT_DISCONTINUOUS.

Or, we can add a feature to avtVarMetadata.

Whats happening is that that Exodus' ElementBlock decomposition is now being treated as an enum scalar instead of a material.

When parts of the enum scalar are turned off, the extents are changing. However, that apparently didn't used to happen when the same parts where turned off as a material.

So, I think the right answer is that somewhere in enum scalar selection, we need to decide NOT to change extents due to changes in the selection.

Now, I don't know if other use cases have a conflicting requirement; that extents should change when changes are made to an enum selection. I don't think that is the case as it would seem to be different than the way we handle selections for domains and materials, but maybe it is."

Open arbpoly-zoohybrid.silo.
Plot mesh of 2D->mesh1_phzl
Plot label of same mesh and show both nodes and cells
Now, pick on zone 9. PIck returns correct zone number but only 3 nodes for this zone even though this is a 6-noded zone and the nodes are wrong.
Try picking on zone 6 too. You get correct zone number but incorrect node numbers. It returns a node, 26, that isn't even in the original mesh.

In helping to debug it, try doing a label plot of an expression of zonetype_label(2D->mesh1_phzl). It will show 'tri' for the 6 noded polygons.

Now, for the arbitrary polygons in this 2D mesh, the Silo plugin is reading those polygons but decomosing into triangles. It may not be appropriate to do this for 2D meshes any more as VTK appears to have decent support for arbitrary 2D shapes (e.g. polygons). In any event, the Silo plugin is doing much the same thing it does in 2D as it does in 3D with arbitrary shapes; decomposing those shapes into zoo-type shapes. The 2D dataset mentioned here is just a good way to test how VisIt is handling this and it appears to not be honoring the *original* mesh.

When VisIt performs a pick, I think it needs to know if the mesh has undergone some restructuring transformation (such as arb->zoo) and if so, then check if the picked zone is part of a zone that has undergone restructuring (not exactly sure how the Pick algorithm could know that though except to look at all its neighbor zones and ask if any have the same 'original' zone id. If they do, then Pick needs to go look at all the zones with the same original zone id, and collect the node ids from those. And, for those nodes, keep those whose original node id is appropriate (I don't know how we tag new nodes that are introduced for purposes of restructuring the mesh. I checked and it looks like Silo code tags avtOriginalNodeNumbers with the pair (domain-id, -1) so a negative 1 value for a avtOriginalNodeNumbers would inform Pick NOT to include that node in pick output.

I think arbitrary polyhedra are becomming more common and so I rated as occasional rather than rare."

Our VTK reader instantiates the whole file contents into memory and then, I think, hangs onto *all* of it.
Reported by Ryan Vignes


When we read VTK, our reader instantiates the whole VTK object in the file into memory and *everything* in the file; every variable defined on the mesh. So, just *reading* the file to see what is in the file involves instantiating the whole 1Gigabyte object into memory. And, we do this on mdserver too!

For single part VTK files, Visit will use only one MPI task to process the data. Worse, however, is that it still winds up *reading* the file on all tasks!. So, for 16 processors, you don't get any speedup in terms of 16-way processing but you do wind up getting hit by a 16x memory consumption because the VTK file is istantiated into memory on every processor.

Doing a top while running on cab, I get the attached image for 16 processors and a single-part vtu file

Finally, if you'll notice in the attached 'top' image, one engine_par process is taking quite a bit more memory than the others.

852,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,Normal,VisIt not reading multi-block/multi-file Silo objects specified with absolute paths,Mark Miller,"",2.5.2,Mark Miller,09/20/2011,"",0,1.0,09/20/2011 01:08 pm,07/17/2012 11:07 pm,2 - Rare,3 - Major Irritation,2.3.0,"","",All,Any,"This was reported by Katie Lewis.

Overlink has an option to use absolute paths for various file operations. When this option is used, the multi-block/multi-file objects it creates in Silo have absolute paths for the filename parts of the block names. That means the file is not easily moved but Overlink indeed has tools to move it if need be. Nonetheless, VisIt at least ought to be able to visualize those files when they are indeed at the absolute paths specified. And, Katie tells me this is not working.

There is a small chance the problem could be in Silo library itself but I don't think so. Silo does attempt to perform some interpretation of file pathname parts of block object names to hand windows/linux slash swapping. So, its concievable that logic isn't handling absolute paths correctly and causing problems. However, more than likely, I think the problem is in the Silo plugin in VisIt where there is a lot of work going on to interpret the file pathname parts of block names.

I did not request data to re-produce because I think we can adjust out test clients to produce test data to tickle this bug."

This lead to two schemes implemented in the plugin and defined at compile time. One uses each node-centered value as a bit-map indicating a node's membership in one of *at most* 32 possible different nodelists. This bit-map scheme is extremely limited to at most 32 nodelists (# of bits in a single integer value'd node-centered field defined on the mesh). The other scheme, which is the default, is somewhat more flexible in that the number of nodelists it can support can be much larger. However, it still places a limit on the number of _coincident_ nodelists any given single node can be a member of. Furthermore, the mapping is complex enough that it is difficult for persons writing Silo data to know well apriori if they may hit or avoid the maximum _coincident_ nodelist membership limit or not.

Cyrus and Brad came up with a simple improvement. Instead of limiting the node-centered variable that gets _painted_ onto the mesh to indicate each node's membership in each nodelist to a single integer valued array, why not define a general array variable of arbitrary length to support an arbitrary number of nodelists? The plugin can then return an array variable to generic database and then the boolean operations to widdle down the set of nodes defined by the current nodelist selection can be performed in generic database resulting a single 0/1 array that gets handed off to the VisItVtkEnumThreshold operator to finally cut up the mesh."

Hello,

It would be preferable if the Tecplot reader made no assumptions about
the meaning of ""x"", ""y"", and ""z"", and just use the first few variables
base on the user selecting the dimensionality of the data.  As far as
I understand, the units suffix has no meaning to Tecplot.

I'm very impressed with the quality of your software, and look forward
to the day I can ditch both Paraview and Tecplot entirely.

That sounds the simplest.  Some of my 2d files are recognized as 2d,
and some are recognized as 3d.  The ones recognized as 3d require me
to use the Project operator expressions of the form {ElectricField_x,
ElectricField_y, 0}.  The ones in 2d expect me to use expressions of
the form {ElectricField_x, ElectricField_y}.

It would be nice to be able to specify which variable is x, y, or z.
Then I can have a left-handed coordinate system by specifying y, x, z,
instead of x, y, z.  This is the trick I have to use in Tecplot in
order for the top of some of my devices to be at the top, and not the
bottom of the plot."

Using lineout tool, he took 3 lineouts very close to each other geometrically, close enough that you'd expect area under curve query from each lineout to be about the same. However, he repeatedly would get into situations where area under curve for one of the lineouts was off by 5x to 10x.

We exported the 3 lineouts to ultra. Low and behold, ultra said there were 4 curves, not three. One of the curves from VisIt was broken into two curves. There was a discontinuity in it when it was exported to ultra. However, as displayed in VisIt's viewer, no such discontinuity existed. The break appeared near a point where there may have been an artificial spike (see another ticket from Brad about spurious spikes in linout). When ultra did the integrals, the sum of the first two curve pieces was the value we'd expect.

When we exported the 3 lineouts to vtk, we got a .visit file with !NBLOCKS 3 and referred to the 3 .vtk files. When we re-read those VTK files back into VisIt (not curves now but 1d meshes), they plot fine but now also show the break (e.g. discontinuity) in one of the curves. And, when we compute area under each curve, we get correct numbers.

So, somewhere under the curves during the process of taking a lineout, a curve was discontinuous somehow. That discontinuity did not show up in the plotted curve but did show up when integrating. The integration query only considered one portion of the curves.

Hank says this behavior is new. He hasn't seen same in previous versions of VisIt and his been doing this kind of thing for months."

This is subtle but I think important.

If a plugin is DIRECTLY dependent on a lib, that dependency is EXPLICITLY handled in the plugin's .xml file. In other words, the plugin source code within VisIt DIRECTLY REQUIRES that library in order to even compile. Now, if through using one of these DIRECTLY REQUIRED libs, some other library dependency is introduced, that is a) unknown the the plugin developer and b) handled by the LIBDEP variable for the library.

Now, it isn't immediately obvious to me whether H5Part is or is NOT directly dependent on the libraries listed in its .xml file. It lists H5Part, HDF5, FastBit and zlib. I don't think its directly dependent on zlib so maybe that needs to be removed. But, it at leasts looks to me like there are libs listed in the .xml file for H5Part that the source code for that plugin is in fact NOT dependent on. If so, those should be handled by defining a LIBDEP variable for H5PART and then listing in that variable all its lib's dependent LIBDEP variables.

I am attaching a short powerpoint outlining some of the issues (and solutions) that I have encountered plotting ALE-AMR SAMRAI data in VisIt. I seem to have found a (mostly complete) fix for using ghost cells in VisIt with SAMRAI. I am attaching patched code for VisIt (2.2.0) and SAMRAI (2.4.4). As you will see a few issues remain (that may be easily fixed by someone with a deeper knowledge of the inner workings of VisIt than I have) but I hope that the fixes I am sending can find their way into both codes. If anyone would like to look at the data sets that I used to generate the plots the path is: /p/lscratcha/masters6/MSLTest/ (subdirectories msl_impact-2d-00008.visit.old and msl_impact-2d-PGC-00008.visit for the unpatched and patched SAMRAI solutions)

573,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,Normal,add logic to magic hook installation script to disallow updates on non-trunk commits,Mark Miller,"",2.2.1,Mark Miller,01/28/2011,"",0,1.0,01/28/2011 11:13 am,02/02/2011 11:52 am,3 - Occasional,3 - Major Irritation,2.0.1,"","",All,Any,"Ok, I think I wasn't describing the situation clearly enough.

1. Someone's commit to trunk updates check_dos and count_tabs hooks.
2. The 'magic' happened and the hooks got installed. All is good.
3. I merged from trunk to my branch.
4. I picked up the changes to check_dos and count_tabs hooks in my
branch.
5. I commit my the merge of trunk to my branch.
6. The changes to check_dos and count_tabs on my branch went along for
the ride as they should.
7. The magic happened and those hooks got installed again, a second time
only this time from a commit on my branch.

Now, branch work should not affect the trunk until it is finally merged
to trunk. I have not merged my branch to trunk, yet my changes (merges
from trunk really) to hooks got installed, effecting ALL COMMITS.

I guess all I am saying is that what occurred in step 2 is correct but
the second time in step 7 is suspect; both because it is coming from a
commit on a branch and because it is essentially re-installing already
installed hooks. In this case, the files are identical (I didn't change
explicitly the hooks in my branch) so no negative effects really
occurred.

As long as there is no need for a branch's hooks to be different than
trunk, then I guess all that really happens is unnecessary
re-installation of the same hooks during commits to branches. But, if
someone really does modify a branch's hooks to be different than trunk
then there is room for a serious problem; the 'installation' of hooks
written for a specific branch. Once they are 'installed' they effect ALL
COMMITS ANYWHERE, not just the branch.

Now, it is not impossible to have branch-specific hook behavior work
correctly. One just has to code the hook to look for specific branch
names and then 'do the right thing' for the branch in question. But,
lets suppose someone does that on a branch, commits it and it works for
a while. But, then someone comes along on trunk with a change to a hook.
Since the branch has not been merged to trunk, the change and commit of
the hook there will 'stomp out' the hook that got committed from the
branch and the branch-specific behavior will be lost until it is
committed from the branch again. But then that'll stomp out the updated
trunk behavior. etc., etc.,

I think the only way to operate is whenever developers need to modify
hooks, they do so on the TRUNK ONLY. Even if they need behavior that is
branch-specific, they should adjust the hooks on the trunk and commit
them from there. Hooks should never be installed on a commit to a
branch. I think I should add logic to the 'magic' installation script to
check and only allow it to occur on trunk.

Sorry for the long-winded email and belaboring such a subtle issue.

It is an HDF5 plugin and when I disable it, Silo successfully opens the file. I think velodyne might be corrupting internal HDF5 lib state before Silo plugin even sees it.

Using 'Screen resolution' and width = 1024, resulting image size

Using 'no resolution constraint' and width=2048, height=4096, resulting

Its ultimate aim, like most FindXXX.cmake modules in VisIt, is to call SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY.

But, SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY's 4th arg, _libs_, is *not* for indicating what additional libraries a package _depends_ on. It is for indicating what additional libaries a package _implements_.

In fact, there does not appear to be any way via SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY to indicate what libs a package depends on.

So, even if we can add logic to FindSilo.cmake to decide if Silo depends on zlib (see below for a patch to do that), it doesn't help us because there appears to be no way to tell SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY about _dependent_ libs.

If silo is configured with compression (which it typically is by default and one has to explicitly disable them), then Silo has a direct dependence on zlib. However, whether to add 'z' to silo or siloh5 targets is currently not being handled in FindSilo.cmake.

Why does VisIt build fine in spite of this? Thats because in most cases, VisIt's build is being driven by a config-site file and there is logic in construction of VISIT_SILO_LIBDEP and VISIT_HDF5_LIBDEP to set up library dependencies correctly. And, this logic winds up skirting any failings in FindSilo.cmake.

So, its a non-issue for config-site builds which I think represents a majority of our builds (so I rated this issue as rare). It is an issue for others.

The correct long term solution is probably to fix FindSilo.cmake to set up proper/correct direct library dependencies (e.g. what does Silo library depend on) and then to utilize CMake's built-in mechanisms for handling *indirect* dependencies and eliminating our VISIT_XXX_LIBDEP variables."

Currently, if a multi-block variable is defined on only some blocks, the data producer is required (by VisIt not by Silo) to create a cooresponding multi-block mesh object with the same missing blocks. This cause the data producer to create mesh objects representing various subset configurations that are otherwise easily defined/constructed by SIL restrictions. In the new approach, a data producer will be allowed to create a single multi-block mesh object and then define upon it multi-var objects that have missing/empty blocks.

We should decide on best approach for how VisIt will then treat a missing variable block. Some options considered so far are...
* Missing variable blocks get filled with a fill value (where data producer and visit user can select fill value)
* Missing variable blocks are treated essentially as transparent (ghosted away)
* Missing variable blocks are colored specially (e.g. kinda like greyed out where data producer or visit user can select color)
** This approach requires some color be set aside from the _normal_ colormaps that can easily distinguish the block from _normal data_.
* Missing blocks impose a modified SIL restriction such that the missing blocks are turned off in the SIL and also grey'd out in the SIL controls window.
** Works fine when SIL is different for each plot (e.g. not using Apply SIL to all plots option)

I think it may make sense to support all of these appraoches in VisIt's interface(s) so that users can vary behavior as needed."

That is probably ok, as long as blueprint quickly decides the file isn't a silo file.

However, it appears to also be  generating error message noise (see below) on stderr (and exceptions in vlog files though I honestly don't know if that is really considered bad form for a plugin that decides it doesn't own the given file. My view is that it is a common thing for a plugin to do that and so should not Except out but can nonetheless log a message about why it decided it didn't own the file)

The HDF5 library can be quite noisey about error conditions, depending on how it is compiled. I dunno if we've got all the right switches set in the way we configure and build HDF5 (honestly, I don't even know if HDF5 library error message verbosity can indeed be controlled at configure time either for 1.8 series or new 1.10).

I do know a call to ""H5Eset_auto(NULL, NULL)"":https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.8/RM/RM_H5E.html#Error-SetAuto will silence it. I do this in Silo unless a Silo caller has indicated it wants error reporting on stderr.

If they open the database at a timestep where the variable is defined, plot it and then move to a timestep where it is not defined, they get invalid variable exceptions and a red plot that will only ever get back to green if they manually re-draw it for a suitable timestep.

If the database returns NULL for a GetMesh/GetVar call, that generally triggers an error. We could define some vtkDataset and vtkDataArray valued constants that a plugin may return to indicate 'variable not available for this timestep' such that VisIt would know that the variable is defined but there is no deta for the current timestep. Additionally, we could add metadata to a variable indicating whether or not it might return these constant valued indicators for some timesteps -- though I do NOT think that is really necessary.

One way to 'fix' the current way we do business is for the GUI to cache plot attributes per-variable such that if a plots attributes are adjusted, the variable is changed and then set back, the user will get whatever settings they last set for that variable. That would certainly address the user request (from Al Nichols), that triggered this ticket.

Thinking more broadly though...

We already have variable attributes as per avtXXXMetaData objects. In fact, I believe these even offer the ability to specify the variables 'extents'. Why not create user-adjustable equivalents of 'variable attributes' so that users can 'do things' on a per-variable attributes basis that make sense. Certainly, setting min/max values is one such thing.

However, we have CL args that influence behavior of various components some of which are documented and handled directly in internallauncher, some of which are documented in internallauncher but not really handled there, some of which are not documented in internallauncher but handled elsewhere (see the slew of engine debug arguments) and, then again, a variety of these are also handled via host profiles. Some arguments seem to have had same name and purpose to different components (e.g. -timeout for mdserver and engine) but recent changes have broken one or the other (e.g. -idle-timeout used to specify engine idle timeout so now mdserver will get whatever its default timeout is which may or may not be same as engine's). Some arguments can only be controlled by passing on CL directly. Others are controlled by both CL and host profiles, etc.

This just seems like a mish/mash of methods for handling the following issues...
a) documenting the meaning of a CL argument in such a way that users can easily obtain it
b) providing nice GUI to set them

He needs to compare results from different simulation runs. Sometimes the runs timesteps do not always line up at exactly the same moments in time. He'd like some way to rule out diffs that are due to slight differences in time (but whihc would have otherwise been the 'same' if the two runs of the simulation were on the same _trajectory_) from diffs that are due to _other_ things. He proposed having VisIt do linear interpolation between timesteps.

At first, I balked on this because I think linearly interpolating between restart or plot dumps would result in garbage data as those dumps are *never* at the a fine enough time resolution that they are not hugely understampled. But then, talking with Matt, we considered the case where the dumps are indeed at the highest time resolution of the code (e.g. every main cycle) at least _around_ the target times of some other run. So, for example, the 'old' simulation could have times of 0.5, 2.33 and 3.7 and the 'new' simulation has a few high time resolution dumps _around_ each of those times. In that case, linearly interpolating through time between the _high-res_ dumps to produce a result at a prescribed time to match an older code's dumps could be very useful.

In addition, not all phenomena modled in a simulat is highly variant in time. For example, maybe the pressure variable is highly time-varying but the mesh nodal positions are not. This would mean interpolating mesh geometry might be ok while interpolating pressure might yield garbage.

At any rate, we have a request for VisIt to linearly interpolate between time states."

In his Silo input databases, he defines a slew of fairly complicated expressions involving intermediate expressions as well as a handful of _driving constants_. He would like to be able to edit the handful of driving constants without having to be exposed to the slew of complicated expressions they are involved in. This involves managing _visibility_ of the expressions in *both* the GUI menu pull-downs and in the expression window and _editability_ of these expressions.

h1. Editability

Currently, expressions from the database are not editable. The user would like the ability to edit db expressions. However, the user would like the ability for the database to indicate if a db expression is editable or not. This would involve a Silo enhancement to tag which expressions are editable. It would involve minor adjustments to avtDBMetaData to carry along this tag to Expression window. Note that _editability_ implies _visibility_. In order to edit an expression from the database, it must be visible in the expression window too. Currently, we have a single check box in expression window which indicates whether to show ALL db expressions or not. The new behavior would be that any db expression which is editable would *always* appear in the expression window, regardless of the 'show db expressions' check box setting.

h1. Visibility

Visibility of expressions involves two parts; their appearance in the expression window itself and their apperance in the GUI's pull-down menus (or CLI's DBMetaData I guess). Visibility in the expression window would be handled as described above - if its _editible_, it is *always* visible otherwise its visible only when the check box to show db expressions is active. The user would like the ability to indicate if expression (variable defined by it actually) appears in the GUI pull-downs or not. For intermediate expression definitions, the resultant pollution of GUI pull-downs is not acceptable. Current best work-around is to define all in a _submenu_.

The user has a Silo database in which are defined long, complex expressions inolving other long, complex intermediate expressions. Only a few of the terms in these expressions does he ever want/need to edit during a VisIt session.

So, the enhancement could be satisfied by adding some new expression parsing delimiters to delimit the beginning and ending of _editable_ portions of db expressions. In the expression window, if show expressions from db is true, those expressions with _editable regions_ are shown in some color other than greyed out.

We allow the cache to grow and grow and grow, hoping that that whatever the user is doing, there will always be enough memory for the current timestep. We clear the cache(s) whenever we change timesteps.

When timesteps are small enough to fit several in mem. We don't. In that case, switching timesteps between the several that could possibly fit in cache results in constant re-reads and re-computes of stuff that could otherwise be cached.

When a single timestep's inputs plus related items cached using the current mechanism and policies grows too large to fit in memory, we entirely run out of memory and suffer an engine crash. Instead, we could simply wind up pre-empting and then re-reading and/or re-computing pre-empted items thereby avoiding an engine crash.

Currently, in our new-handler in the engine, we have no way to identify what things we could reasonably free up as we have no idea from among the items in the cache, which have been more recently used or not.

If we had some LRU based mechanism with pre-emption, then some of the questions about when to cache or what to cache would be replaced by a single question, how big a cache do we need? We would cache as necessary, expecting that that whenever we reach the limit of memory for cache, we pre-empt (e.g. remove) something old, freeing space for the new thing. Even if we wound up freeing and then re-constituting stuff, because the existing cache size limit is not sufficient for the operation(s), that is far better than crashing an engine. Though, if we wound up with extreme thrashing, that may not be any better than crashing. However, even in that case, we'd at least be able to detect it, halt the execution appropriate and issue a warning message instead of just crashing.

I am told the trick is in computing amount of memory used by any _thing_ we aim to cache. We are typically caching VTK objects or AVT objects that have VTK objects within them. And, VTK objects share other VTK objects. So, computing the memory usage may be tricky. In addition, removing objects where there are complex VTK interdependencies may also be challenging. But, "

Put up both parabolic and going_down curves and draw both.
Now, hide and unhide the going_down plot. The view extents change back and forth to accomodate either just the parabolic (going_down hidden) or both. Thats fine.

Ok, what if I don't want to the view to change? What do I do? I see Controls->View->Curve and don't see anything there to affect that. I try advanced tab. There I see 'locked view' 'maintain view limits' 'viewe based on pull down orig/actual spatial extents.' Boy all these kinda sorta sound like what I want. But what the heck are the differences between these?

First, I try 'view based on...' and use actual extents and hit apply. Now, hiding/unhiding going_down has no effect on view. It seems to me that its effectively locked. Why? I set view based on 'actual' so I thought that as I hide/unhide, the 'actual' extents would change and the view would change. So, I go back to 'original'. But, hiding/unhiding going_down still has no effect. Its like the view is totally locked now, why? I didn't lock it.

I hit 'reset view' with both plots UNhidden. Now, seems like I am back to where I started. The view now changes as I hide/unhide going_down.

Next, I trie 'lock view' when both plots are UNhidden and hit apply. Now, view stays the same as I hide/unhide going_down. Ok, so now I uncheck 'locked view' and hit apply, expecting it to return to old behavior of changing view as I hide/unhide going_down. Well, it nothing changes. Unlocking the view seems to have had no effect.

I hit 'reset view' with both plots UNhidden and hit apply. Nothing changes, as I hide/unhide going_down, view stays constant. 'reset view' is having no effect now.

I now delete the plots and re-create them but in reverse order. Now, going_down is first and parabolic second. Now, I get back to the behavior I had before. As I hide/unhide going_down, view changes. Ok.

Now I check 'maintain view limits' and hit apply. Now, as I hide/unhide going_down, view does not change. Gee, that seems a lot like 'locked view'. Why are there two check boxes for the same behavior? Oops, but wait, I uncheck 'maintain view limits' and hit apply. But, as I hide/unhide going_down, view does not change.

For curve views, the intent of these advanced controls is unclear. Maybe for curve views some of the controls are synonymous, in which case, they maybe should be gray'd out. But, the GUI itself is confusing. On top of that, the behavior is inconsistent and seems to depend on the order of plots in the plot list, the order of hide/unhide and what is hidden or unhidden at the time of setting view, etc.

Finally, this was submitted because Matt O'Brien did not want 'reset view' in curve mode to include curves that were hidden in the resetted view extents."

It has to do with material (region) specific variables. That is, variables in Silo that exist on only some materials. The DBOPT_REGION_PNAMES option of var objects in Silo is used to control this. The orig. design was intended for this option to list all relevant material names a variable was defined on (e.g. restricted to). However, there are drivers for both Al and Randy in which it is highly desireable to write one ucdvar object per-material. I consider this an abuse of the feature. At any rate, to support this case, writers will construct a multi-var of multi-vars.

At the domain level, write all the region-specific ucd vars you want. Also, at that level, create a multi-var object that points at an (arbitrarily long) list of such ucdvars. 

There will be two levels of multivars; the normal 'top-level' stuff which will have one entry per domain as you've always done and the domain-level multi-var which will have one entry per region-specific ucdvar.

But, there will be a DBOPT_REGION_PNAMES option on multivars AT BOTH LEVELS; the top-level and the domain-level. In addition, that option will include the 'union of all region (material) names' the variable is defined on. Top-level is more important than domain level. It prevents VisIt from having to chase all over hell's half acre to get information about the material list the variable is defined on during a file open operation.

In addition, each multivar will have the DBOPT_MMESH_NAME on BOTH LEVELS of multivars. At the top level, it will be the name of the associated multi-mesh. At the domain level, it will be the name of the associated domain-level 'normal' ucdmesh."

Indeed, Quadvar code for single component variables (scalars) is handling major_order feature of a Silo variable.

However, it does not look like same is true for multi-component quadvars (vectors). We don't seem to be doing anything with the major_order feature of a Silo variable then.

So, my quick conclusion is this is a bug in the Silo plugin in VisIt.



From Jakob van Bethlehem...




I'm creating output of my simulations in .silo format and came across a 
peculiarity when using DBPutQuadvar. I attached a piece of minimum code 
that reproduces the problem (quadvec2.cc)
It produces a simple vector field and a scalar field. Then I create a 
quadmesh for it and use DBPutQuadvar1 to put the scalar field on the 
mesh and DBPutQuadvar to put the vector field on the same mesh. In this 
particular example I use the x-coordinate as the second coordinate when 
filling the image, which will put the image in the right orientation 
when using Silo-row major orientation, which seems to be the default 
(AFAICS the orientation for Silo files as set by DBOPT_MAJORORDER should 
be thought of with respect to the X-axis, meaning that M[X][Y] will 
appear right when setting it to 1 (column-major) and M[Y][X] when 
setting it to 0 (row-major))
And indeed, I get the result as in quadvec2_roworder.png, which are the 
correct results. But let's now change the ordering by setting 'column=1' 
in the code. This should rotate everything a quarter circle, since we're 
effectively changing the axes. Now the result is quadvec2_colorder.png 
The figure shows that the scalar field did rotate, but the vector field 
didn't (even though, when investigating the .silo output with silex, in 
the properties of the scalar field the major-ordering is correctly set 
to column-major (1)! ) Especially because of the latter, I suspect this 
is actually a bug in VisIt, or the Silo-reader of VisIt, but maybe I'm 
misunderstanding something here.

Actually, this wouldn't be too much of a problem, if it weren't for the 
fact that all my code uses the convention C[X][Y][Z] for datacubes, 
hence I really need the to set the ordering to column-major for correct 
visualization.

That mysteriously kept failing and that caused me to bring everything 
down to the little example program I created, which shows the problem by 
forcing a 'wrong' visualization.
BTW, after finishing all this I note that I don't pass the optionlist to 
DBPutQuadmesh - there is no reason for this in particular. However, even 
though I know that the Silo-library is a bit fishy when it comes to 
passing options to different functions (see eg bug 465), in this case 
passing the optionlist with the correct ordering set to DBPutQuadmesh 
does not resolve the problem.

Anyway... I'm curious about the thoughts of other users. And in 
particular: if this is indeed a bug in VisIt, whether there would be a 
quick work-around (not involving me rewriting all my code from using 
C[X][Y][Z] to C[Z][Y][X] please) until the bug is fixed in VisIt??"

For each multimesh in the file, it cache's some information to facilitate matching to multivars. However, the information it caches is only the *first non-empty* block name. Now, if a cooresponding multivar has a different *first non-empty* block, the block names won't match up. To fix the logic, it would be necessary to cache all block names for each multi-mesh. Thats prohibitive at scale so we won't do it.

The right answer is for data producer to use DBOPT_MMESH_NAME option for all multivars. This option allows data producer to explicitly specify the mesh associated with a multivar.

I discovered this one accidentally because the embedded application was 
getting confused and applied the slice and clip operators to the same 
plot.  When this happens in a specific order, the engine crashes instead 
of creating the plot.

To reproduce the error:
1) Open a data file (For example purposes I used multi_rect3d.silo out 
of the data directory, although one can use any 3d data)
2) Add a 3d pseudocolor plot
3) Add a slice operator
4) Turn off ""project to 2d""
5) Add a clip operator
6) hit ""Draw""

On Windows, the engine_ser will crash - you'll get an error box that 
says that the engine exited abnormally and VisIt was unable to create 
the plot.

On Mac, the engine_ser will happily run forever without returning.  On 
my machine, it was consistently at 48% CPU utilization.

When I ran all db tests, the Velodyne plugin was reporting a close failure indicating that it is leaving an object in the file open. I spent some time looking over the code but decided I didn't want to take time to find the problem and fix it. So, I am logging this ticket instead.

The reason I rated this higher likelihood and severity than you might ordinarily think (how often do any of us use Velodyne plugin) is that if Velodyne is enabled, then attempts to open HDF5 files will perhaps trigger a Velodyne attempt and Velodyne's failure to close prevent subsequent HDF5 plugins from being able to open."

2.4 installs on a Mac like a _normal_ Mac app. Thats great. But, when you double click on the launcher icon, you only get a serial VisIt. There is no option to launch a parallel VisIt. Willy wants to launch with @-np 8@ argument. In the past, he did that by making an alias with full path to VisIt _binary_ (script) appending @-np 8@ to the command line. He was able to _fix_ this simply by using new path to VisIt binary launcher script for 2.4. But, he'd like a launcher icon that either a) asks for number of processors or b) can be programmed to set number of processors or c) always uses all processors that are available.

Jeff would like VisIt to be able to operate in such a way that it can recognize a series of directories as a _openable_ time series or even an individual directory as an _openable file_.

The use case is that he would like his code to write all parts of a multi-part file including the _root_ file containing all the multiblock objects to its own directory.

The problem is that when the _root_ files containing the multi-block objects are not all in the same directory, there is no way for VisIt to _see_ them as a time series. However, this kind of storage structure is very convenient to Jeff because all the files, including the _root_ for a given timestep stay in one directory. It can be easily moved around and shared with other users without having to remember it is a _thing_ with two parts.

Jeff is willing to limit this use case to where both the encapsulating directory and the _root_ file within that directory are identically named.

More from Jeff...


Couldn't the change can be completely isolated in the function MDServerConnection::ReadFileList()?

If (isDir(filename)) {
   newFileName = filename + '/' + basename(filename) ;
   if (fileExists(newFileName) && isStandardFile(newFileName)) { 
      filename = newFileName ;
   }
}

What am I missing?

Again, moving to this would not just simplify things for our team, but for every team.  Other teams could get rid of their hokey hacks and better encapsulate their data for their users if you tell them this is available.  Think of it this way -- in addition to simplifying file management, it could halve the number of items people have to stare at in their directories.

The extra check only occurs if the filetype is a directory, so the performance impact should be limited for the vast majority of users.

His data includes 3 coords for the centers, 3 radii for the 3 major axes plus 3 3D direction vectors.

To get him going, I took Brad's advice and suggested he use the tensor plot. So, he currently creates a point mesh for the ellipsoid centers and then creates a tensor variable on the point mesh such that the eigenvalues are his 3 radii and the eigenvectors are his 3 direction vectors.

So, there is a transformation from his _native_ data to what he stores in the file and consequently browsing his data textually via Silo's browser or with pick/query returns the _tensor_ form of the data and not his native data.

So, first issue is that We ought to handle his data _natively_ so pick/query return what he's expecting.

Next, he also mentioned these other issues

1) Color the objects by a variable. I know that this will require a bit of work, as a variable is being used to generate the ellipsoid, and we want to use a different variable to color the object...

He was correlating 3 dbs. Each has a different number of states and wildly different cycle indices but approx. similar time indices.

He choose to correlate in time because that results in _best_ behavior but still not what he expects and I kinda agreed with him.

With a time-correlation, he still winds up hitting the 'next' VCR button 3 times to get all 3 dbs' windows' sync'd up to the next state. Thats because all 3 dbs are close but not at exactly the same times. Of course, this problem also worsens the more dbs in a correlation.

Brad explained that the way time correlations work is to take the union of all time indices from all databases and create a single series of time values that the slider and VCR buttons navigate.

Something Willy suggested was to instead have the option to _pick_ one of the dbs' as the _master_ for time indices (maybe the _first_ one in the correlation). The time slider and VCR buttons would then navigate only this (sub) sequence of time values/indices and make the other's _slave_ to that (e.g. pick the closest time state for all other dbs in the correlation).

The problem is that a 'make clean' can never remove .o's and .so's it no longer knows about and this can happen when a plugin or other source files gets removed or renamed.

So, I was thinking an additional make target might help such as 'plugin clean' or 'very clean' where 'plugin clean' means all plugin .so's are removed via some kind of find or *.so operation as well as all the object files for the plugins and 'very clean' means something like ""find . -name .svn -prune -false -o \( -name ""*.[oa]"" -o -name ""*.so"" \) -exec rm -f {} \;""

As an example, I am making a room that is 5 meters by 5 meters by 5 meters. However, the window is about 1 cm thick. So we would roughly need a mesh at the 1cm  level to find an overlap.

We should probably do like we do in the engine polling activity loop...We start by polling as fast as we can and do so for a period of a few seconds. If nothing happens, then we insert nanosleeps to reduce polling activity a few orders of magnitude. It allows the engine to be maximally responsive as long as the user is triggering work but quickly falls back to very low activity when idle.

And.

Since VisIt is a C++ code, in all cases of the wrapper approach, the MPI C Plus Plus wrapper is (must be) specified. Otherwise, none of the C++ code would compile correctly. CMake's FindMPI module finds libmpichcxx.a to link to.

When we encounter a C code that uses MPI, like xdmf examples, we run into problems because we compile *and link* with a C compiler but link to a C++ implementation of MPI libraries *without* a -lstdc++ on the link line. This results in unresolved externals for C++ standard library functions like 'new' and 'delete', etc.

If we use the explicit approach to setting up MPI flags/libs, then I don't think we encounter this problem because we only ever link to a C implementation of MPI. Currently, we don't ever use MPI's C++ interface anywhere in VisIt.

Our options are to
* eliminate the wrapper approach
* get smarter about *only* linking to the C implementation of MPI even for a wrapper
* allow for C++ and C variants of the MPI compiler."

He recently got a new windows desktop. He says its a windows 7 system.

When he runs VisIt on rzzues and displays back (via X), everything starts up fine but when he tries to plot anything, it all vanishes and he gets an error message on the xterm where he launched VisIt indicating he should contact VisIt developers.

I asked him to run glxgears and it seemed to run fine though the gears did not actually appear to spin. I suspect frame rate was so high it was not possible to tell. When he ctrl-c'd, it wrote a message indicating frame rate was 57.2 frames per second.

He can run VisIt from rzzeus and display to another laptop he has. So, I don't think its his rzzues enviornment.

I've asked him to install VisIt on his windows 7 machine and see if he can run it locally there.

I've also attached viewer and engine debug logs from his session that failed to plot a mesh plot from globe.silo but I can't see anything suspect in them. They don't even indicate a bad exit situation. It feels like something way down in the low-level communication conduits between components.

Instead of that, I am thinking it would be good to just make it possible for users to import host-profiles, or for that matter an XML content we use (e.g. settings, color maps, etc.) from a URL.

That way, folks supporting VisIt at super-computing center X can publish and maintain their own host profiles and then just advise users on where to go to get them.

Yes, it might still be good if VisIt itself 'knows' the URLs for commonly used cases, too. But, its easy for us to maintain a list of URLs. Its harder if we also have to maintain the host profile files themselves."

We have done some work in this regard already in developing a set of sub-commands in VisIt's python CLI that mimic some of ultra's features.

However, not all ultra features map easily to VisIt curve expressions or operators and not all of ultra's commands were implemented and, in
any event, we don't have the resources to implement many of the more advanced ultra features anyways.

Another option that is attractive is to provide ease of integration of VisIt curve data with numpy/scipy array objects. That means being
able to easily access a VisIt curve as a numpy/scipy array as well as easily plot a numpy/scipy array as a VisIt curve. So, its bi-directional.
If this one capability was in VisIt, users would have the option of learning to do ultra-like things in numpy/scipy or just continuing to
use ultra.

Note, there was apparently some attempt to implement ultra commands in python by a summer student;/usr/gapps/pdv/bin/pdv.

* Problem of type 1: Plot too small
** !visit_test_image_3.png!
** This is an easily fixed problem but thought I would point it out anyways. Most of the image is blank. The solution is to ensure plot fills as much of available image real estate as possible. We aren't checking for this in testing and maybe we should compute the pixel coverage metrics and initially warn a developer of a would-be baseline image of this kind before committing and using it in testing.
* Problem of type 2: Image too small to reveal important details,
** !visit_test_image_2.png!
** This image is supposed to demonstrate VisIt's ability to deal with ""missing data"" where some data is plotted but some values in the input are missing but I think it is just as likely that missing and non-missing data points are landing in the same pixel masking the intended effect of the test.
* Problem of type 3: Image being used where non-image comparison
        would be better
** !visit_test_image_1.png!
** This image is a curve plot. Why not just compare the actual curve data instead of some rendered version of the plot, especially for plots with wide dynamic range, a lot of the little variations are washed out in *any* image reasonably sized or not. At 300x300 image size, we're saying any variations less than a third of a percent are not relevant.
* Problem of type 4: 2D input scene too busy.
** !visit_test_image_4.png!
** 2D rendering involves resolving the color at each pixel. When input scene geometry density is too high, many primitives map to the same pixel. What we see then in a 300x300 is determined somewhat by an arbitrary order of operations. The same scene presented in a different ordering will result in a different. Maybe I am confusing or planar 3D issues with true 3D issues here though.
* Problem of type 4b: 3D input scene too busy.
** !visit_test_image_8.png!
** This is the same as 4 but with 3D data. It isn't clear to me whether 3D rendering has the ability to improve or make worse the problem of input scene primitive density being too high. On the one hand, there is an additional dimension used to disambiguate what gets drawn to a pixel. So, it sounds like 3D ought to be less sensitive to this problem. On the other hand, just looking at the image visually, I am not sure I can say for sure that the rendered output is what I was expecting.
* Problem of type 5: Lighting, shading or view angle obscures important details
** !visit_test_image_5.png!
** In this example, shading and angle to eye is such that 3D input scene variation is washed out. This isn't true of the whole image here but is true of a large portion of it. If we employ metrics to determine image diffs, this kind of image result has the ability to dilute the metric.
* Problem of type 6
** !visit_test_image_6.png!
** Basically the same as 4 but in this case, we are testing a 'scatter plot' in VisIt. So, the sort of funky shape and appearance is indeed what we want to test.
* Problem of type 7: Key details from calculational work performed by VisIt not rendered at fine enough detail.
** !visit_test_image_7.png!
** This is testing a very important capability in VisIt: Material Interface Reconstruction (MIR). It is testing one of several MIR algorithms and key aspects of the result I think are muddied by image size and/or choice in view zoom.

If we embarked on an effort to improve our choices for test images, the examples above might serve as a good starting point on how to improve things. In addition, we should consider things like sensitivity of test results to irrelevant changes such as in compilers, third-party-libraries, running at single our double precision, parallel rendering vs. serial rendering, etc. In addition, just because an image exhibits one or more of the problems mentioned here doesn't mean the whole image isn't testing something useful. But it does mean that the non-useful portions of the image wind up diluting any metrics we might choose to use as a means of disambiguating acceptable differences from unacceptable ones.

For certain, to zero-order an across the board re-baseline to 1kx1k image size would help to reduce though probably not in all cases fix these issues. It would likely also help to prevent us from introducing new issues of these same kind. The only downside is an increase in storage needed for baseline dir in our repository and subsequent checkouts. Given the current size of our repository on NERSC systems, ~1.5Gb, the increased storage would be 2-3%, so really not much. There would be about a doubling of the size of a checkout of the test directory. Where image results are posted for browsing, we would probably have to reduce the number of months we maintain previous test results from maybe 6 to 4.

Honestly, to sift through ~2800 images and identify *just those* we think should be re-baslined at 1kx1k as opposed to just doing all of them isn't really worth the trouble, particularly when the only thing it saves us is 100-200 megabytes of disk space. Disk space is cheap. Developer time isn't."

exception handling. Although it appears C++ has some built-in
capability for things named ""underflow"" or ""overflow"". several sources on the web explain that C++ exceptions are software
related and not at all the same as FPE exceptions which are hardware
related. The latter tend to be caught by the CPU, handled by the OS and
sent to the offending process via signals (use sigaction() interface).

I don't know how easily this would integrate with VisIt's normal
exception handling but I'd guess it would go something like this...

* set up sigactions to catch a prescribed list of FPEs (underflow,
overflow, divide-by-zero)
* add signal handlers that receive FPE signals and then package that up
into a new class of VisIt exception
* add, where appropriate, catches for this new class of VisIt exception
in our filters/pipelines

Since something like divide-by-zero can happen in many circumstances involving user input and data from external files, the granularity at which we decide to catch such exceptions is probably very important. For example, if we caught them only at the very top-level in the engine, a plot with only one value among millions causing a problem amoung millions would wind up not plotting anything instead of maybe plotting everything but with one data value set to some MAX value say. In fact, maybe it makes sense to employ VisIt's _missing data_ funtionality to allow us to gracefully handle FPEs but warn the user of their occurence.

One other thing that occured to me when looking up how to catch FPE signals is the opportunity to perhaps _recover_ from SEGVs. We can catch this condition as a signal and then maybe issue a warning message to the user (albiet probably not clean up all that tidily from the error) and give the user a chance to save a session and/or exit from VisIt more gracefully.

I think this would only ever have to be done on the engine."

<pre>
Are there settings that can be used to control the resolution scaling for
VisIt.app in OS X?  I am trying to use a prebuilt executable of VisIt on
a MacBook with retina display, and the default scaling generates very
³grainy² text.  This can be fixed by changing the scaling of *everything*
to ³More Space², but I¹d prefer to keep the scaling at ³Best² for
everything but VisIt.

If this can be addressed by building from source, I can do that ‹ I am
using the prebuilt executables because I ran into some issues between
clang and Qt when trying to build VisIt 2.6.3.  (Maybe these are fixed
with 2.7?)

Honestly, I am not able to see the difference on my MacBook Pro but my vision isn't that good either.

The attached image, when you zoom in, you see a clear difference in the text rendered in VisIt's GUI and the text rendered by, for example, the terminal app. Note that I had to zoom in on the image before my eyese could see the difference.

1763,Rejected,VisIt,Bug,Normal,pick warning message and raise window gestures/events,"","","",Mark Miller,03/04/2014,"",0,"",03/04/2014 06:14 pm,03/25/2014 08:08 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,2.7.1,"","",All,Any,"Richard Sharp mentioned this was an annoyance for him.

A common means of raising a window in most window managers is moving the mouse into the window and then clicking anywhere in that window.

When using VisIt with multiple VisIt windows open, a user may naturally need to raise various windows frequently. There is, of course, a way to do that via the VisIt main panel by pulling down the menu of windows and selecting one to be active. But, that interface is not as intuitive as simply finding the window visually on the screen and clicking in it.

Depending on the window mode the VisIt window is in (e.g. if it is in 'pick' mode), then clicking in the window to raise it, does raise the window but also generates an error message from VisIt, ""Chosen pick did not intersect surface"", which then must be dismissed. Note that in navigation mode, zoom mode or lineout mode, such an error message does not get presented. For lineout and zoom, even if the click in the window is followed by an inadvertent slight drag, if the neither the click or drag intersect the viewport, no lineout or zoom event is triggered in VisIt nor is any error message and so the effect for the user is just that the window is raised. That is the desired behavior I think.

Now, the same is not quite true for navigation mode. In navigation mode, even if the click and inadvertent subsequent drag *do*not* intersect the viewport, a view change event is nonetheless triggered *and* the window is raised. Actually, I think a majority of viewer window operations wind up getting handled this way. That is *both* the window is raised and the VisIt action identified by the gesture is performed.

So, depending on the VisIt window mode, we have at least 3 different behaviours for how VisIt responds to attempts by a user to raise-by-clicking a window...
* raise window, perform action whenever its makes sense (navigate mode)
* raise window, ignore action if its nonsensical (lineout, rubber band zoom)
* raise window, generate error message if its nonsensical (node/zone pick)

Some options to consider
* eliminate the 3rd behavior (e.g. warning message generation) but that might mean we loose the message also in cases where its more useful to the user
* if the initial click in the window results in a raise event, perform the raise only (e.g. ignore the initial click-to-raise click). While this kinda makes the most sense to me, I also think it represents a different kind of behaviour for the way VisIt operates a majority of time and so may now introduce confusion/annoyance for more users.

It can wind up removing lines on the extreme edge of a mesh. The algorithm marches over cells and then edges for each cell. For each edge, it determines neighboring zones sharing the edge. For any edge for which two neighboring zones come from the same original mesh zone, the edge is removed. But, that logic removes edges that are on the extreme boundary of a mesh. I think the logic should be face based instead. For each cell, it should loop over the faces and for each face, over the edges and if an edge is found that is shared between faces that come from the same original mesh zone, then the edge should be removed."

Ale3d currently does have a mode to run in where it puts each timestep in a separate directory like so…

For restart files...
<pre>
foo_128_00100
    foo_128_00100
    foo_128_00100.1

where the directory name is the same as the file containing all the multi-block objects (aka 'root' file). However, this mode doesn't work with VisIt for a couple of reasons. First, VisIt doesn't recognize a sequence of *dirs* in the filesystem as a time series. Second (which is a bit more of a stylistic issue) it *requires* the user to descend *into* a dir and find the root file before s/he can 'open' a timestep. So, this mode of Ale3d output is currently not friendly with VisIt.

Now, other codes have taken a slightly different approach to this problem by creating a master file (multi-block objects only) at the same level of the dir containing all the block files. But, this causes a time series in the filesystem to be seen as <master-file,dir> *pairs* and is stylistically unattractive to some users. There is a preference to have a point in the filesystem hierarchy that contains only a single entity (which would *have*to*be* a dir) for each timestep.

So, the problem is enhancing VisIt to treat this case (a series of dirs with 'root' files in the dirs of the same name as the dirs) properly. A key question is what this might mean for Visit's file browser GUI window. A double click on a dir in this context means to 'open' that dir and not to descend into it to browse its contents. We may need to affect some kind of preference or additional button in the file browser GUI to avoid *constantly* checking every dir we see for this 'special case' of a file by the same name within the dir but we may in fact be able to do that with minimal/trivial performance implications. An option is to *before* descending into a dir in the file browse window, check to see if there exists in the dir a file by the same name and then attempt to 'open' the dir as a timestep instead.

Some codes are switching to operate all-multi-part-all-the-time and so getting this in is crucial to supporting those codes.

Since GetFileListFromTextFile presumably returns *only* the list of files within the text file, it can do all the magic of finding these keywords and pull them out/apart from the rest of the file list.

However, right now, FileList assumes GetFileListFromText file *does not* remove any of the special keywords in the list.

In Silo plugin, we use the @origin@ member of the @DBucdmesh@ object to set @cellOrigin@ of avtMeshMetaData object. Thats wrong. It should use the @origin@ member of the @DBzonelist@ object to set cell origin. 

There are potentially two things we are trying to achieve with an @origin@ setting in Silo.

The other is to let a visualization tool like VisIt know where to start numbering things at.

Try mesh plot and then try subset plot. Both go through a calc external facelist step (deduced via watching Compute Engine dialog) that takes a very long time (more than a minute) on my Mac on one processor. On more processors, of course it goes faster. But, still way too slow given the size of the dataset. And, not sure why this step is even necessary in 2D

The challenge in using this data in the vector plot in test outputs in VisIt is that its too susceptible to changes in order of operations causing huge variations in coloration of the plot.

I propose we root out all the cases where this vector data has been created/copied in our test data and then adjust it to be non-constant magnitude and then re-baseline all the tests involving it.

Another way of (not) handling this is to simply clamp the color range of the legend used in the py test files to a slightly wider range."

It would be best if VisIt has some tolerance for this so that, internally, it could detect when this is happening and then pass that information around to parts of VisIt that could usefully respond. For example, if the mappers and legend are aware that even though min-max is non-zero it is so close to zero that it might as well be zero would be useful.

We had a similar issue with an idle engine waiting in an MPI_Reduce operator in the main even loop for input from the user and resolved it by writing our own MPI_Reduce.

There is a session file too.

# Open the database
# plot a mesh plot of 'mesh'
# plot a pc plot of 'hflux_error_norm'
# draw
# move to timestep 2 (probably not relevant)
# Add threshold operator (ensure apply operator to all plots is enabled)
# hit draw and you get a segv'd engine

Now, you should get an error message that it cannot apply threshold to 'mesh' plot and that is a correct error message.

But, the engine shouldn't segv.

I looked in debug logs and found this near the end…

* Start VisIt with -noconfig on the command line
* Open some database and put up some mesh plot. Don't worry about drawing it though.
* Add the threshold operator but do nothing to change it. Bring up the threshold operator attributes and Hit the 'save' button and give it a nice name ""default_threshold.xml"".
* Exit VisIt.
* Now, start VisIt as you would normally, add a plot and a threshold operator. Bring up threshold operator attributes and hit the load button and load the ones you just saved. Hit apply. Hit Make default if you want that to be your new default. And, if so, be sure to save settings."

By far, I'd bet the most used button of these is the 'apply' and maybe next the 'dismss' buttons.

To free up some space, we could roll most these up into an apply button next to a button with a pull-down specified action that defaults to 'dismiss |>' (thats the word Dismiss with a right arrow next to it indicating other options are available.

2070,Pending,VisIt,Bug,Normal,filename extension matching oddities and switching to regexs,"","","",Mark Miller,11/22/2014,"",0,"",11/22/2014 01:01 pm,11/25/2014 07:15 pm,2 - Rare,2 - Minor Irritation,2.7.3,"","",All,Any,"We use WildcardStringMatch, a function defined in Utility.C (as an aside, I think all string related functionality should be moved to StringHelpers.C). This method is used in at least these places…
* matching filename extension with database plugins
* matching hostnames in host profiles

WildcardStringMatch supports 3 meta characters
* @*@ which matches a whole string of characters
* @?@ which matches any single character
* @#@ which matches any digit character

Ok, here are some oddities
* The internals do a case-insenstive character match. Why?
** This might be relevant to hostname matching but not so much to filename matching (except maybe on OS X)
** We have several plugins that define uppercase chars in their patterns but case-insensitivity makes that irrelevant
** The name of the method doesn't suggest its case-insensitive. I assumed it wasn't until I ran into problems and looked at the source code.
* The case-insenstive matching uses custom code instead of just using tolower stdlib method. Any idea if this is actually necessary?
** As an aside, I noticed a similar thing in StringHelpers where we have a custom case insensitve string compare instead of just using strcasecmp. Again, is this really necessary?
* The @#@ supports the notion of a _digit_ but only a single digit and only 0…9
** not hex digits (e.g. @0xFA10@)
** not chars that one might find in a float such as @e/E, +/- and .@)
** If you want to support filename extensions like @*.exo.1.0@ as well as @*.exo.1024.0010@, you have to specify patterns with 1 and 4 @#@ chars
* You cannot define a file pattern that uses a literal @#@ character. Might be strange but why are we excluding it?
* Turns out only 3-4 plugins actually use any meta chars in their file pattern definitions. I don't think this capability is well known. The Exodus plugin has been in poor shape on this point and fixing it resolves a couple of issues for Exodus users at ARL for example.

Should we switch to a more general regular expression approach? I think regex's are difficult for people to grasp. OTOH, using Exodus plugin as an example (which defines about 7 basic extensions), and thinking of 1 million cores, we'd have 7*7=49 extensions to cover all the possibilities whereas only 7 regex's would cover all of them. And, its easier to craft regexs that don't need to get re-visited with minor changes in conventions on how files are named or when different groups of users choose slightly different conventions (around a common base extension).

We could define/adopt a more abstract filenaming _schema_ similar to the way the Unix _date_ function defines a schema for printing of dates (and times) which supports notion of things like block counts, processor ranks, cycle numbers, timesteps, base extension, problem tag, etc. In fact, the combination of regexs and a filename schema of sorts might enable VisIt to do a better job teasing relevant information from filenames alone."
2105,Pending,VisIt,Feature,Normal,prime multi-window save settings from window sizes and relative positions,"","","",Mark Miller,01/05/2015,"",0,"",01/05/2015 08:15 pm,01/07/2015 02:12 pm,"","","",3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"I went into a 2x2 layout and then wanted to do a multi-window save.

I was surprised by my first result. A largely black image with a tiny single window in the lower, left corner. It render all 4 windows on top of each other!

I guess I had assumed it would 'do the right thing' and save a multi-window that was equiv to the 'layout' I had chosen.

In cases that windows are not moved or adjusted in size following a 'layout' setting, I think this should happen automagically.

Even when windows are moved or adjusted in size, I still think it should be possible for VisIt to make an educated guess about what the user wants in the way of a multi-window save and then prime the settings for it from that. 

Certainly, VisIt should probably warn the user when settings are such that windows will overlap substantially."
2110,Pending,VisIt,Feature,Normal,adjust default vector plot attributes to relatively prime stride,"","","",Mark Miller,01/07/2015,"",0,"",01/07/2015 01:37 pm,02/17/2015 04:34 pm,"","","",3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"Default vector plot attributes draws 400 vectors. However, I don't know how the plot determines which of the 400 vectors to plot. In any event, it is all too often the case that the default plot winds up sampling the mesh positions such that the resulting 'shape' of the plotted glyphs doesn't nicely cover the whole object. This happens *a lot*. 

I think we either need to adjust the sampling algorithm for the target glyph count method *or* (much easier) switch to a default of 'stride' but set stride to a number that is relatively prime to the mesh dimensions (am assuming mesh dimensions can be known in the plot attributes -- maybe they can't be) in which case choose a 'stride' of 'auto' by default and the plot filter can decide it.

This would alleviate situations where default behavior often winds up being misleading to users.

As an aside, it would be better to allow the _stride_ setting to be float greater than or equal to one. Yes, its called 'stride' and is in fact used to walk through the array. However, the stride could be a float and the stride algorithm could just round the offset into the array to the nearest integer index each time it needs to access the underlying vector array data. This would make it much more flexible in arriving at a decent value for a stride in a dataset whose size is factored by several of the integers less than 10 say."

Font issues
* text overlapping

* text not scaling well as image size is varied
* text not saving well when saving images

Python Code Examples
* A lot of our examples apparently using older python (1.7)

* I explained 3.0 was a challenge for us due to some major changes
* Update to CLI manual?

Session File issues

Additional Issues / Details

# Use the extra CNTA funds we have to improve the user interface / invest in useability.
# Problem where the fonts are specified as a percentage of the screen size, so when you switch to a different monitor they can change in size and sometimes run off the window.
# Wants to save his session file in the same place that his data is, not on his local machine (I guess he’s running in client-server mode).
# Session files are difficult to restore correctly (can’t be shared).  Two users were in the same room with a seemingly identical connection and couldn’t share session files successfully.
 
# I could have sworn I had trouble using the same session file I saved in the Gnome Desktop virtual application on the HPC portal in the SRD environment.
# Since it takes a long time for my images to render, I’d like to be able to restore a session with sources and not have it automatically re-render all the images.
# I was trying to make a tiled movie, and it didn’t seem to matter much whether I used 1 processor or 16 processors---apparently, based on the timing of the messages I was getting, it was taking about 80% of the run time just loading in our tecplot-like .plt files.  I couldn’t ever keep the connection open long enough to make the whole movie (I estimated 60 hours.  Each file was about 9GB.), so I had to settle for simple movies of each tile.  Each of those took about 7 hours to put ~60 frames into a .wmv movie with a 0.5 second dwell time for each frame.  Perhaps I need to switch to 2000 processors.  :-)"

However, in general, VisIt does not re-decompose the input data. It is able to process in parallel on a number of processors that is not more than the number of parts the input database is block into. For image and *some* netcdf files, I believe VisIt can re-decompose those on the fly, but that is the exception rather than the rule.

Although making VisIt warn users about possible under-utilization is undesireable, we can provide information in the Compute Engine's window from which they can make that determination for themselves.

This ticket is to enhance Compute Engine window with information on processor utilization of past (maybe past several) executes. What percent were idle, maybe what memory usage is across them, maybe even load balance. Heck, how about a VisIt plot that displays load balance of most recent engine executes?

The idea is that a user would like to take a horizontal (x-axis parallel) or vertical (y-axis parallel) lineout and would like to drag while holding down some key (typically the shift key) to cause the drag to snap to these directions. Common snap-to directions are verticle, horizontal and 45 degrees. It might make sense to have a little bit finer granularity here but whatever.

For rotations in navigate mode, a user wants to rotate *only* about y axis or *only* about x axis and would snap their drag motion to affect that. Note that in 3D, a snap for a radial drag even might be novel too as that would be a rotate about z axis. Also, maybe the number of degrees the object is rotated is snapped too, maybe in 22.5 degree incriments or something.

Note that we also support curve (curve and ultra) and 3d formats (stl, obj, vtk) and we should keep those.

Our postscript output is brain dead. It saves a raster image using the postscript dialect. I thought it was at least smart enough for curves to save vector format.

Do scatter plot with electrons_dt in X and electrons_p on y.

Thought it was related to narrow x-range of data. The x-bounds for the viewport are 1e-7 apart and was assuming GL hardware was having same kinds of problem as when we zoom in way to far.

Can be scaled independently in x and y if use expressions to scale the variables. However, user finds issues with that as well.

Jonathon Smith at Tech-X also reports.
<pre>
I wanted to comment here. The underlying issue responsible for this
(treatment of double precision data as single precision) remains in
VisIt 2.9.2 on windows. The users we're supporting want to look at
non-transformed data. The end users we're working with want/need to have
the labels representative of the raw data, so ideas like scaling or
translating the data are not being received well.

The only way we could satisfactorily use an expression containing a
translation to the data (so it's centered on 0 to avoid this issue) is
if we could also force some sort of false labelling so that the data is
labelled as it would be with the original coordinates centered around
1.8e-7 seconds with variations of order +/- 1e-11. It seems that the other
visualisation tools we've tried have not run into such problems, and a
better solution would be to ensure we have a pipeline for native double
precision data. I'm happy to contribute to resolving this issue by
testing code, and even hacking source with guidance as needed. I think
the issues have not moved on much from those described in my older post
(13th March)

If I recall - the problem is that we call
avtTransformManager::NativeToFloat: needNativePrecision=false,
admissibleDataTypes={VTK_FLOAT,VTK_DOUBLE,}
this code is somewhere in
the engine, and shows up in the engine log at debug level 5. It may also
show up at lower levels, I've not checked, but it *is* still happening
in 2.9.2.
This statement clearly comes from
avt/Database/Database/avtTransformManager.C, but the problem is
understanding what's calling it and why.
It appears to be getting called within avtMissingDataFilter (not sure
why this is used here, as it appears the dataset is complete, but this
is probably my ignorance).

I think we'd learn something by instrumenting the ""if"" statement around
line 360 of plots/Scatter/avtScatterFilter.C with some extra debug
information, then to start working backwards from there.

Do we need to ensure that we call something similar to NativeToFloat,
called avtTransformManager::NativeToDouble: needNativePrecision=true

What is responsible for calling the transform manager,  and what might
we be able to do to modify it's behaviour. Presumably this was once
needed as VTK historically couldn't handle the double precision dataset.

What if someone plays it safe, first does a debug build with build_visit and then after confirming everything is working, does a release build but without removing the TPLs?

However, the collinear case is very bizarre. The fortran code to write it is a bit funny (thats another story) and VisIt seems to display it strangely.

The variabes are qmesh/mat and qmeshcl/matcl (for collinear case)

* First, plotting the two meshes results in different default view in VisIt. I have no idea why. Both meshes are identical as far as geometry. But, VisIt displays the collinear case squashed in Y direction.
* Next, I am unable to pick on the clean zones. I get pick didn't intersect surface. But, this happens only for the clean zones.
* Next, I am unable to pick any node on the collinear mesh
* Label plot of zone/node ids seems to display what I would expect
* After I've done something like a material selection (or maybe just the label plot), then I can pick on clean zones.

Second, its quite annoying for users to deal with. An error popup *always* occurs and there is no way to disable it.

That said, in other respects, VisIt seems able to continue moving through time and even recover an error'd plot when the data for it because available again in a later state.

So, maybe all that is required here is to change how we handle this one special kind of situation from an Error to a Warning (which can be disabled but nonetheless, a user can still go to the output window to see whats happened if the ever need to).

The new Mili plugin will serve up in PopulateDatabaseMetadata strings for stress variable such as ""sx"". But, for Mili users, the stress variable may be available at a large variety of different _integration points_. For example, the data producer may compute stress at 40 _integration_ points. It may save to a Mili file say only the values for 5 of those _integration points_, say 1,2,3, 15 and 37. A user plotting ""sx"" variable will get the values for its _default_ (maybe first defined) integration point. However, a user using GrizIt or VisIt's expression system could construct a string, say ""sx,3"" (or maybe ""sx~3"" or ""sx[3]"" or some other syntax that does not collide with expression system or potentially cause other problems in VisIt) which means to plot the variable ""sx"" for the integration point 3. This string will NOT pass VisIt _sanity checks_ for either it being a valid variable or for other things that avtDatabaseMetadata my wind up trying to perform on the string. So, the idea here is to adjust the _sanity checking_ logic for variable names in VisIt to ignore all characters in a variable name *after* some sentinel or *between* some delimiter chars (e.g. _guard chars_) In our example, integration point 3 exists in the Mili file. The point is that the extra characters in the variable name are understood by the plugin. The plugin can do the right thing given the string. But, we don't want these extra characters to effect anything else in VisIt. We just want VisIt to pass the whole string along to the plugin with the understanding that the plugin will _know what to do_ with the extra stuff in the string. If the requested integration point is not available, either the plugin can through an invalid variable exception or opt to select the closest available. However, in the latter case, its important to warn the user that the requested integration point was not returned and then also tell the user what actual integration point was used. This latter bit of messaging may be achievable via warnings from the plugin or may require some additional enhancement for the plugin to send textual information to the user.

Its conceivable the sentinel or delimiter chars chosen here could be specified by the database itself. In other words, we add a field to avtDatabaseMetadata indicating the guard char and allow the database to select chars other than the default if desired.

The python _GrizIt_ script is designed to allow engineering users to use Griz commands they are familiar with to interact with VisIt.

At present, there is no adopted way to get information back to users regarding some aspect of the database they have opened. Some degree of messaging is currently achieved by a combination of, _File Information_ (which is basically a textual realization of avtDatabaseMetaData), graying out of variables in the GUI, and exception/warning messages. One example may be Mili library version number.

For information that is associated with the database as a whole, its possible we could support a more general, arbitrary text object as an extension of the already existing functionality for the _database comment_ field. This approach may not be sufficient however because its associated only with the database itself and doesn't provide messaging that can vary in response to different GetMesh/GetVar calls issued on a database plugin.

So, another route to go here is to support adding generalized textual information on vtkDataArray and vtkDataset objects returned from a plugin. VisIt can inspect the returned objects and if it finds attached to these objects some ""avtMessageInfo"" object (or some such thing), do the work to push the string either to the ''output"" window or as a separate popup dialog.

2602,Pending,VisIt,Feature,Normal,Support Engineering User's Integration Point variables via Subset Controls,"","","",Mark Miller,04/12/2016,"",0,"",04/12/2016 07:51 pm,05/04/2018 05:06 pm,"","",2.12.3,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,GrizIt,"Engineering users have variables with multiple _integration points_. The way to think about these is that they are multi-valued variables. For example, if you have a pressure variable over all zones of a mesh, its like having, in each zone a slew of different values for pressure. Each value is computed at a slightly different position within the zone but nonetheless interpreted as the zonal value. Another way to think about these in VisIt parlance may be as array variables. Though, as I understand Chad, only one among the numerous possible values is ever used at any one time and that is different from a VisIt array variable which is kind of a VisIt vector variable on steriods.

There are two groups of integration points; all those actually _computed_ by the application and those actually _written_ to the Mili database for visualization. We call these _all_ integration points and _available_ integration points.

Typically, Engineering users only ever look at one of the available integration points at a time. Each integration point is like a normal VisIt variable. Its like a mutually exclusive set of variables only one of which can ever be displayed. Do Engineering users ever want to see multiple different integration points in the same plot (e.g. maybe several curve plots derived from different integration points)? The answer would effect whether subset controls (proposed below) is a suitable approach.

We could treat each integration point as a sub-menu variable. So, if _pressure_ has 5 integration points labeled 1,3,4,8,17, the plugin's PopMD method would define ""pressure/ips/1"", ""pressure/ips/3"", ""pressure/ips/4"", ""pressure/ips/8"", ""pressure/ips/17"". That is certainly the easiest way to think about them. However, with large numbers of integration points, this approach quickly becomes unwieldy. And, in any event, we still loose track of representing for the user the notion of _all_ integration points.

It would be better to add support for this via avtArrayMetaData variables and subset controls similarly to how _species_ are handled. A potential space performance issue with using an avtArrayMetaData variable is that VisIt will have to request that the plugin always read _all_ array variable components (e.g. integration points) even if the user is only every looking at one among them. We can consider optimizing this space performance issue away later though.

In any event, in the subset controls window, we can present a list of _all_ array variable components (e.g. integration points) with those *not* available gray'd out. The user could mutually exclusive select from among the _avaialble_ (not gray'd out) integration points and that would effect which integration point is manipulated/displayed in the plots. In this way, integration points would behave kinda sorta like _species_ variables, which we already handle via the subset controls window. The key distinction being that like _species_, integration point subsetting is really subsetting the _value_ space (or range) of the field and not its domain whereas other subsetting functionality is subsetting the domain of a field.

Its not too hard to envision cases where users might want do something like see the average of several of the available integration points. If the integration points have some reference (u,v,w) position(s) within a zone, I could envision the user wanting to specify a uvw-box and then averaging or iterating over the available integration points in that box. But, this would be an advanced feature beyond what Engineering is currently requesting.

The required enhancements are somewhat involved...
* Enhance avtArrayMetadata to specify a map of the _available_ components (e.g. in this case integration points)
** In use, the plugin would define the total number of components (e.g. integration points) (say something like 50 or 100 for number of components) and then also, optionally, specify a vector of ints of those actually available (say 1,3,4,8,17).
* Enhance avtArrayMetadata to specify a bool that array components should be treated mutually exclusively (e.g. only one should ever be used at a time).
** It is concievable that a GetVector call down to the plugin (which is used for Array variables as well as Vector varaibles) could then be enhanced for this mutually exclusive case to also specify which single component to read. This would address the space performance issue mentioned in the paragraphs above. But, this is an optimization we can defer to later if it is not easily implementable.
* Enhance avtGenericDatabase::GetOuput to do something like _ArrayMemberSelect_ (similar to SpeciesSelect or EnumScalarSelect) which does the work of selecting one, mutually exclusive array component, among many available (and to choose closest if selected is not actually available).
* Enhance avtSILRestriction and avtSILRestrictionTraverser to handle array member selection similarly to species selection
** In particular, handle the mutual exclusivity of the member selection
* Enhance GUI for subset controls may need modest enhancement as well, probably to display the list of array members (allowing some to be grey'd out for those that are not available).
* If there are cases where multiple integration points need to be in the same plot, we could relax the mutual exclusivity constraint, or the user can use VisIt's expression system to define an expression involving multiple of them.

In fact, now that I think about this, maybe instead of doing any of the above, the plugin just loads up such variables as Array variables (avtArrayMetaData during PopulateDatabaseMetadata) and the user just uses the _[[array_decompose | http://visit-sphinx-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quantitative/Expressions.html#array-expressions]]_ expression to pick a given component (integration point)."

But, I think we *could* maybe do this...
         Leave all FATAL_ERROR messages unchanged

Its 32-way Exodus data. Some files define 3 element blocks, some 4 and some 5.

I've opened this data in serial VisIt, the *first* file it examines has 3 element blocks and so it decides there are only 3 element blocks during populate database metadata. The additional blocks in those files that have 'em are ignored. Thats BAD. Simply changing which file VisIt thinks is the *first* file to open so that it opens a file with 5 element blocks _fixes_ this.

In parallel, I seriously have no idea how VisIt can get it right because there appears to be no communication regarding the element block count. Thats bad.

OTOH, we don't want VisIt opening *all* files in an ensemble just to obtain element block count.

What is the solution?
* Require that all Exodus data producers always indicate global element block count in each file. For non-existent blocks, the exodus file will have to have a zero element block for those blocks. That basically fixes the problem by enforcing data producer to produce uniform exodus data. 
* Provide database open option to specify the element block count manually?
* Provide !NBLOCKS-like directive, !NELEM_BLOCKS that indicates the block count
* Just require that any .visit/.exodus file have the file with greatest element block count at the head of the list
* Open all the files and find the global element block count. In parallel this may not be as bad as it sounds.

Note that this is identically the same problem we have with Mili and for which we had the unsatisfactory solution of a makemili tool. The long term solution we are hoping to get LLNL Engineering customers to use there is for data producer to do effectively the work makemili would have done but at mc_close (Mili close) time. By adding logic to Mili's database close method *and* requiring data producer call it collectively on all processors, we can do work in Mili library to gather up information from individual ranks and then write the unified information to the mili database.

It might be worth thinking about a generalized strategy for this for products like Mili, Exodus, netCDF, VTK, Silo, that would be available to codes to just sort of use out the box.

I mean, if we open a database with an 'array' variable, we have one plot that apparently by default attempts to plot all the components. That is the label plot. For label plot, I don't see an easy way to turn off certain arrays or only see certain arrays. For other plots, we have the reverse situation. We don't have an easy way to display certain members. In fact, the aggregate Array variable object doesn't even appear in most of the plot menus.
 
Now, the work-around for this is for the user to define expressions that construct variables from the components of the array variable. But, that is inconvenient and inefficient.
 
I am wondering if it makes sense to add to the subset controls window the ability to enable/disable certain members of an array variable. In many ways, this is similar to 'species' selection which is already handled via the subset controls window. There is the question of what happens as we vary the 'output' of the selection say between a single member (e.g. a scalar mesh variable) and say 3 members (a vector mesh variable). But, I think having this kind of control (in a common place and not per-plot) would be hugely more convenient.

But, its a bit hidden from view. In fact, the *only* plugin that exploits it is Silo. I have been working with MOAB and Mili plugin developers dealing with this issue and we have always stumbled over the issue that its not easy to handle PopMD in parallel whilst being efficient in terms of filesystem interactions but keeping the algorithm simple.

I recommend the following to help ease development of db plugins for parallel...That VisIt *automagically* broadcast metadata (from rank 0) and only avert that if a plugin requests *not* to. This would be a new feature on metadata object. Call it the mdBcastRank. If set to -1, then its off. Otherwise, it specifies a rank to use as broadcaster and will do the broadcast just prior to return from call to PopMD in the avtFileFormat methods. We would have to touch many existing plugins to *turn it off*.

Also, I believe ANSYS file *requires* 3 integer columns for node #, solid #, line # *before* coord values.
Your file has only node #. I think a correctly formatted ANSYS file has white space for the other columns
when those columns are not used. OTOH, why do they have a programmable 'format' string that is
capable of indicating the number of columns? Very strange issues with this format documentation.

There are some point to clarify concerning the files I sent.

the problem with the APDL converter is that if there are 0's among your coordinates it will erase them.
 
so if 3e stands for 3 columns of floating points, what about 6e???
I am sending both original files for reference.

However, Visit's expression system cannot, in general, re-produce this continuity for expressions involving the original continuous fields in non-linear ways. The picture below shows the issues.

!non_coforming_plots.jpg!

Left: x (blue) and y (red) contours of *continous* components of a vector
Middle: Contour plot of the magnitude of the vector as computed by VisIt's expression system.
Right: Contour plot of the magnitude of the vector as computed by data producer *and* with same continuity constraint enforcement as in original fields, namely that the dofs at the hanging node *must be* the average of the dofs at the ends of the longer edge it shares.

There are a couple of options...

Here are a couple of options to consider going forward...
* Define 'constrained' nodes for a ucd var in Silo
** This would be an optional object to associate with a field in Silo such that it defines, for each node, whether the node is constrained in some way and, if so, the constraint expression. So, for the case you had, the constraint would look like 0.5*Ni+0.5*Nj where Ni and Nj are node ids in the mesh. If the constraints for all fields on the mesh would be the same, we can associate the constraints with the ucdmesh object and not with ucd vars These constraints could then be applied by any expression VisIt performs resulting in continuous fields.
* Create a 'conforming mesh' operator that takes a non-conforming mesh and turns it into a conforming mesh
** Given no information, it would have to find nodes that are ""hanging"" nodes and then subdivide neighoring zones to make them conforming. Finding hanging nodes might be difficult in general. So, this might require that the input mesh at least be annotated in some way to indicate which nodes in the mesh are non-conforming This already has some precedent in VisIt where, for example, we take arbitrary polyhedral zones and subdivide into zoo-type zones."

We can remove all the special case code for curves and simply allow curves to be treated like any other quadmesh/quadvar objects.

In some cases, we may want to ask the quadmesh/quadvar if it meets the requirements to be treated like a curve (1D topologically and spacially) so that we can decide if it should appear in the Curve Plot's menu, etc.

But, otherwise, we should remove all the special case code for curves."
3154,New,VisIt,Bug,Normal,optional dbs never built in releases but built for testing,"","","",Mark Miller,05/31/2018,"",0,"",05/31/2018 08:35 pm,05/31/2018 08:35 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,2.12.3,"","",All,Any,"We have _required_, _minimal_ and _optional_ categories of databases in src/databases/CMakeList.txt

We have several dbs that are categorized as optional
<pre>
        Hex
        MRTest
        PICS_Tester
        Rect
        VLI
</pre>
Of these, none are in our releases (that I can tell), Rect is actually part of nightly testing, PICS_Tester is also included in _minimal_.

First, not sure what the rationale is for these categorizations. Second, why are we testing stuff we don't use? When do we actually use these other plugins.

My desire...
* Make rect a normal plugin...its useful sometimes.
* Can we craft the CMakeLists.txt file here so that it produces makefiles for these other plugins *always* but then either you have to manually cd into those dirs to make those plugins or we provide some additional make targets to make them when we want them?
* I mean, why do we have to suffer a re-cmake step to get makefiles for these? Instead of controlling these at cmake-time, lets me it to make time.

* Do a lineout.
* Now, save it to an ascii curve file two ways
* Save 1: Use save window to do it
* Save 2: Use export db to do it.
* Compare the resulting files
* The exported file appears to use approprate number of digits in ascii values.
* The save as file appears to always use %16g (I think)
See attached examples

I actually think the bug this is demonstrating is fairly common for users to encounter. But, I think it is rare they migth actually take notice."
