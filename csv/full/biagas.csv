May I suggest: if the Windows environment variable VISITSSH is defined without an executable, that VisIt give a warning or error, rather than simply trying to connect forever?
When I defined VISITSSH, I forgot to include ""plink.exe"" after the directory location. When I attempted to connect to the remote host, VisIt would just sit there with the ""metadata server launch progress"" dialog, with its marching radio buttons, showing the message ""VisIt is waiting for a metadata server to launch on...""

When we observe this signal and update a plot or operator's attributes, then we are going through the atts->Notify/UpdateWindow process more frequently than we should.

I suggest one simple change:
Turn off keyboard tracking for all QSpinBox instances (myspinbox->setKeyboardTracking(false)).  For typed input, this means the 'valueChanged' signal would not be emitted until return is pressed or the spinbox loses focus.

This helps for the case of typing input into a QSpinBox.  It doesn't help with the up/down arrows, and I'm not sure if this aspect should be addressed as well."

Hello,


I just joined this mailing list to post a VisIt bug I discovered the other day and it's fix. I would suggest creating a better medium for reporting bugs, as joining this mailing list (with two? administrative authorizations required) is quite cumbersome for someone who is not as much interested in developing VisIt, as just trying to be a good citizen. Yet this is all there is in the FAQs, and there is no guidance on the webpage in general about where to send bug reports.


On to the issue.


Operating System: This bug only effects Windows machines, and I've only tested it on Windows 10 using Windows Power Shell.


Version: VisIt 2.10.20, Python 2.7


Issue: VisIt fails to launch in the system's Python when any arguments are passed to visit.exe.


Steps to reproduce:
Run in python the following lines:
import sys
sys.path.append(<path-to-VisIt-site-packages>)
import visit
visit.AddArgument(<any-argument-you-like>)
visit.Launch()  # this will fail


this also fails, since it essentially just adds the '-nowin' option:
import sys
sys.path.append(<path-to-VisIt-site-packages>)
import visit
visit.LaunchNowin() # this will fail


Reason: 
__read_visit_env in frontend.py in lib/site-packages/visit is not correctly parsing command line arguments on Windows. This may date back to Brad Whitlock's fix in 2013 (according to the comments at the top of the module)? The issue seems to be that Windows reads [""visit.exe -my -args -here"",""-env""] as a program called ""visit.exe -my -args -here"" which takes in one argument, ""-env"". Then it dies because it cannot find a program called ""visit.exe -my -args -here"".


Fix:
Since the string with ""visit.exe"" and the arguments other than ""-env"" comes from __visit_cmd and works fine on Unix, the best thing is probably just to parse that string at the moment we are tacking on ""-env"" and creating a list, creating instead a list where ""visit.exe"" and each argument are separate items.

Change line 250, which currently reads ""pcmd = [vcmd, ""-env""]"" to the following:
pcmd = vcmd.strip().split(' ') # please note there is a space between the quotations!
pcmd.append(""-env"")


I've tested this fix on my machine, and the issue seems to be resolved. I haven't been able to test it in earlier versions of Python or Windows, but the Python docs for the Popen constructor (2.6 is the earliest docs I can find) seem to suggest an argument format like the one I use to resolve the issue, so I would expect that this change would only increase stability and not affect other environments.


Thanks!
Christopher Strickland

I would expect at most 2 nodes, the root and the leaf, though single-node seems optimal.  Somewhere between the reader and this filter, we create a tree 3-deep.  That seems wrong.

I looked at the dumped input/output avtDataTrees for every filter in my pipeline and discovered that avtFacelistFilter increased the depth by 1.  That also seems wrong.
The facelist filter was applied twice in my pipeline, so the extra depth became more noticeable.

Personally, I don't think it should appear at all, but if others believe cycle should appear regardless of whether or not the reader provides cycles, then its appearance in the legend should be consistent for all timestates.

GUIBase.C has helper functions that convert from double to QString and back again for use with LineEdits.

According to Qt 4.8 documentation, QString.setNum(double) by default uses 'g' format with precision of 6.
I think we should change our use of setNum for double to increase the precision, perhaps to 17?

Then ensure all GUI windows accepting doubles use the GUIBase helper methods: DoubleToQString (and variants),
and LineEditGetDouble (and variants).  This will help maintain consistency.

A workaround:  modify visitmovietemplate.py to call 'visit_composite' instead of 'visit -composite' and change frontendlauncher.py to exclude 'visit_composite' from having '-forceversion' added to its command line (the way it is excluded from mpeg2encode).

I discovered some oddities with curv2d, in that Pick will return different center than ZoneCenter, but even worse, OnionPeel will highlight a completely different cell. (I often use OnionPeel in conjunction with Pick as a sanity check.)

Here's a small script:
<pre>
OpenDatabase(silo_data_path(""curv2d.silo""))
AddPlot(""Mesh"", ""curvmesh2d"")
AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""d"")
DrawPlots()
#do a pick before Onion peel
p1 = PickByZone(482)
#Add Onion peel of same zone, see if it ends up under the pick letter
AddOperator(""OnionPeel"")
op = OnionPeelAttributes()
op.index = 482
SetOperatorOptions(op)
DrawPlots()

#Now dd a boundary plot, do the same pick, see if get same results.
AddPlot(""Boundary"", ""mat1"")
DrawPlots()
p2 = PickByZone(482)
if p2['point'] == p1['point']:
    print(""PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots yielded same point"")
else:
    print(""PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots DID NOT yield same point"")
SetQueryOutputToObject()
q = Query(""Zone Center"", element=482)
if (q['center'] == p1['point']):
    print ""ZoneCenter query returned same coords as Pick""
else:
    print ""ZoneCenter query returned different coords than Pick""

#Now feed the zone center as coordinates into a pick:
p3 = ZonePick(coord = q['center'])
print ""Pick using coord from Zone Center query returned zone: "", p3['zone_id']
</pre>

Here's the results:
PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots yielded same point
ZoneCenter query returned different coords than Pick
Pick using coord from Zone Center query returned zone:  513

Now, if you Make the OnionPeel'd Pseudocolor plot active, and use the mouse to Pick on that zone, Pick will return zone '585'.
But we told OnionPeel to use zone '482'.

I think the difference is in the handling of ghosts, more specifically the 'AVT_HAS_GHOSTS' ghostType.

This target is supposed to allow building the simulation examples despite the flag being off.
On Windows, with visual studio, the all_simulations project is NOT part of the build, but all of the examples are, so they are built regardless. (I use Build Solution, not the ALL_BUILD target, I believe if the ALL_BUILD was used to build the solution, this may not happen).

I discovered this when I changed how PARALLEL settings are passed to the projects on windows:  the sim examples failed to build because I hadn't modified their CMakeLists.txt to account for the new PARALLEL handling. 

Upon investigation, adding 'EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD 1' to the sim examples target properties will prevent the examples from being built using 'Build Solution', but also prevents them from being built by attempting to build the 'all_simulations' target.  When this flag is set, the examples can only be built one at a time.  Not an ideal situation.

A possible solution:
in tools/DataManualExamples/CMakeLists.txt

IF(VISIT_DATA_MANUAL_EXAMPLES)
   # this is the current usage
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Simulations)

   # this will prevent the projects created in the Simulations directory from being added to the VisIt solution file.

One other tiny thing I discovered in the GUI is when I go to Controls->Query, selected Pick and then ""Pick using domain and element id"", when I turned on ""Do Time Query"" check box, I guess it sets some defaults for the Time curve options. But, I don't think the defaults are selected relative to the ""PIck using…"" selection. The default I got was ""Preserve Picked Coordinate"" but I was doing a ""Pick using domain and element id"".

when variables names are compound names (i.e. /foo/bar/density), such as those read with netcdf, I can do a pseudocolor plot of the variable, and I can turn scale = log in the pseudocolor attributes

the error comes when switching to a volume plot (ray-casting), when switching the volumeplot attributes to data scale = log; it causes a failure because the variable's name gets truncated to its first string.

Example, read the aou.cdf from the netcdf_test_data examples.

the variable is available as ""aou"", or as ""as_zonal/aou"".

I can pseudocolor ""as_zonal/aou"" with or without log(), but doing a volume plot with scale = log results in a failure and the message:

viewer: An invalid variable (as_zonal) was specified.

here is the reproducer:
=============

The test prints out DatabaseCorrelation Information, Window Information, as well as the normal SaveWindow tests.

timelock_09 prints window information, including currently active timesliders. On windows, the correlation time slider for window 3 is not being listed. I believe this is the source of the failures for tests 10 and 12 as well.

timelock_08 is also demonstrating an issue with annotations re-appearing. 

When I run timelock.py directly  with visit -cli, I notice that after the call to 'SetTimeSliderState(36)', none of the windows update as they should, being locked in time.  Window 3 will update to the correct time state if I click the window header to make it the 'active' window from Windows perspective.  Windows 1 and 2 do not update (demonstrating VisIt does not consider them correlated with window 3).

The information for Correlation01 shows all 3 databases (wave.visit, wave1.visit and wave2.visit) being part of the correlation.

Getting inconsistent results when calling 'TimeSliderNextState' with different windows active.
Sometimes they work, sometimes I get:

VisIt: Warning - VisIt did not set the time state for these windows: 1, 2.The ti
me slider in cannot be set by the active window's time slider since the correlat
ions of the time sliders have nothing in common.

To avoid this warning in the future, make sure that locked windows have compatib
le time sliders.
1L

'TimeSliderNextState' more frequently at least updates the active window
'TimeSliderSetState', the window doesn't updated until Windows thinks it is the active window.

I've attached three images that demonstrate using rect3d:
  pc_alone: just the Pseudocolor plot before Mesh plot is added
  pc_mesh:  after adding mesh plot, the back top edge appears 'highlighted'
  pc_mesh_deleted: after deleting mesh plot, looks like the back face is 'elevated', causing the 'highlight' effect.

Currently, the necessary defines are encapsulated in our xml2cmake tool (GenerateCMake.h).  

Eric pointed out that this adds effort when adding a new third-party library, as not everyone might realize that our generation tool
needs to be modified as well.

This information should probably be created as a new cmake var in the Find modules. 
xml2cmake would then only parse those variables.

Eg. FindHDF5.cmake would add HDF5_DEFINES(_HDF5USEDLL_) for Windows builds.

hdf5 readers' xml files would probably need to add the ${HDF5_DEFINES} as a CXXFLAG (or new tag?)

I think this would also help with the plugin-vs-install generation code.

What he would really like is to be able to rotate in very small increments (eg move mouse 1 pixel).
Due to the slow response of mouse-interaction with very large data, he suggests adding controls
for perhaps arrow keys, that would rotate at a specified increment.

He does not want to use bounding-box mode as that makes his picture disappear, and he needs to see 
the picture in order to determine the correct direction/amount of rotation.

For example, a right-arrow key press would rotate in the x direction 1 pixel (or whatever increment
had been specified).

Values were not accepted until I pressed enter, and that moved me to the next screen.  I had to use the back button to go back and change the viewport properties for the second viewport, then hit enter again.

I didn't think overwriting this file was good, so attempted to choose a new location.  When I do, the 'open' button is greyed out, and I cannot do anything but cancel.

In order, they yield the following Logged commands (as Query with keyword arguments):
<pre><code>Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0, 0.16, 0), start_point=(0, 0, 0))
Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0, 0.16, 0), start_point=(0, 0, 0))
Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0, 0.16, 0), start_point=(0, 0, 0))
Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0, 0.16), num_samples=100, start_point=(0, 0), use_sampling=1)
Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0, 0.16, 0), start_point=(0, 0, 0))
</code></pre>

h3. Questions

The logging yields these results due to how the command is carried to the viewer as a QueryRPC.

For compactness and consistency ... 
1) Should the Lineout version from the cli be deprecated and removed?
OR
2) should the logging be modified to present the ""Lineout"" form? 
OR
3) leave well enough alone :)

Pick behaves as (2), special logic is added to  the logging to show 'Pick' instead of 'Query(""Pick"")'.
If we choose (1) for Lineout, should the same be done for Pick?

S3D uses the legacy NetCDF-3-C++ API, but databases/CMakeLists.txt

really is a different package and is mostly superseded by NetCDF-C++

=============================================================
Thank you Andreas for this FindVisIt.cmake, it's very useful.

For those like me who use the VisIt source directory instead of an installation path, you may want to add the following at line 24 of this FindVisIt.cmake:

list(APPEND VisIt_INC_SUFFIXES sim/V2/lib)
list(APPEND VisIt_LIB_SUFFIXES lib)

In the source directory libsim is indeed in sim/V2/lib, not in libsim/V2.
To properly find VisIt from its sources, use (for example with version 2.5.2)
set(VisIt_ROOT path/to/visit2.5.2/src)

Depending on how much we want to delve into cmake-isms for our installs, there are other cmake files we might want to add to our install (looking at the installs for vtk/xdmf/hdf5(when built with cmake)):

VisItConfig.cmake
VisItVersion.cmake
VisItTargets.cmake
VisItTargets-release.cmake
VisItLibraryDepends.cmake

Most projects places these files in a 'CMake' subdirectory of lib when installed.

1756,Pending,VisIt,Bug,Normal,Possible memory leak using lib sim,"","","",Kathleen Biagas,02/27/2014,"",0,"",02/27/2014 03:07 pm,03/13/2014 12:23 pm,3 - Occasional,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,2.7.1,"","",All,Any,"From Flavio Calvo's email to the users list:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I contact you concerning a memory leak problem when using together the Geometry>Resample and Slicing>Slice operators with a large amount of data. More precisely, I have the following problem: I am instrumenting a simulation using libsim, and after using VisIt some time with the simulation, the simulation gets killed.

After monitoring memory usage when running VisIt with the simulation, I found that normally, when adding operators to variables, memory is allocated and when the operators are removed memory is deallocated. However, in some precise circumstances (when both the Geometry>Resample and Slicing>Slice operators are active and the simulation mesh is very big) the memory is not deallocated after adding and removing a new operator.

This problem can be reproduced using the fscalar.f file from https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/2.0.0/GettingDataIntoVisItExamples2.0.0.tar.gz (this is part of the didactic code you provide with the tutorial ""Getting data into Visit""). Actually, the mesh in fscalar.f is very small and the problem does not manifest. However I join to this e-mail a slightly modified version of fscalar.f instrumenting a big mesh called ""mesh3d2"" and corresponding scalar data on the mesh named ""zonal2"". When running fscalar (as a simulation) instrumented with VisIt, the problem can be reproduced in this way:
1.	Add>Pseudocolor>zonal2
2.	Operators>Geometry>Resample
3.	Operators>Slicing>Slice
4.	Change ""Slice"" attributes and choose a valid intercept (100 is ok for example)
5.	Uncheck ""Project to 2D"" in ""Slice"" attributes
6.	Draw
7.	Monitor total memory usage. For example in Linux 'ps -A | grep fscalar' outputs '26843 pts/7    00:00:00 fscalar', so the PID is 26843, and then the command 'pmap -x 26843 | grep total' outputs 'total kB          930408  661096  618068', ie 930408kB used.
8.	Add any operator, for example 'Geometry>Dual mesh' and immediately remove it (no need to draw in between).
9.	Draw
10.	Check again for memory. This time I get 'total kB         1406704 1137308 1094248', ie 1406704kB used.
So that when adding and removing 'Geometry>Dual mesh' (but it also happend with any other operator), memory usage raises from 930408kB to 1406704kB.

When doing the very same manipulation without resampling or without slicing there is no memory leak at all. If instead you repeat the same manipulation (with resampling and slicing) but with a smaller mesh, there is no memory leak either.

As I am working with very big meshes, resampling is required in order to visualize the data fluently. Moreover, slicing is often needed, so that even if this problem seems very uncommon and hard to reproduce, it can be quite inconvenient when dealing with large amount of data. As I said, after using VisIt for some time with these memory leaks, the simulation gets killed by the operating system (more precisely after it requests more memory than available...).

I am using in the server side Visit 2.7.1 with libsim V2 (the most recent Visit binaries available in the official website), and Visit 2.7.1 compiled from sources in the client side (I have a 32bits machine and you do not provide 32bits binaries).

I also tried to replace VISIT_OWNER_SIM by VISIT_OWNER_VISIT and VISIT_OWNER_COPY in the simulations instrumentation but the problem remains the same.

This was supposed to prevent bloat and speed up things, but I'm not sure it's still needed.

I ran across this while running Brad's simulation tests.

Test case simulation/mesh.py, does a 'disconnect' then attempts to 'connect' to the same simulation.
In /src/sim/V2/runtime/VisItControlInterfaceRuntime.C  Burlen added a call to 'vtkVisItUtility::CleanupStaticVTKObjects' in order to clean up leaks.  I had to comment out this call in order to prevent a segv when running this simulation test.  The segv occurs during a call in avtGenericDatabase::GetMesh to vtkTrivialProducer::SetOutput.

Either our use of the trivial producer is incorrect, or the way we register/cleanup static objects is incorrect, or possibly both.

The only other time we call 'CleanupStaticVTKObjects' is when the Engine exits, and then only if DEBUG_MEMORY_LEAKS has been defined.  So I don't think it's ever been tested or possibly was never intended to be used on an active pipeline."

I recently added a 'zonesWereSplit' flag to avtMeshMetaData as an indicator in the pipeline that the reader did the cell splitting (as opposed to an operator that splits cells).

I think we need a better, more consistent way to handle arbitrary polyhedral data.

Couple of thoughts:
* VTK supports arbitrary polyhedra via VTK_POLYHEDRON cell type (also supports all kinds of QUADRATIC cell types)
* A pipeline contract field could be added so that filters can state where or not they can handle arb poly cell types
* Splitting of arb poly cells can be done in a single place (like transform manager) when a given pipeline cannot handle the cell type natively
* May need a new method of notifying pipeline filters (or queries) that the original data was arb poly in nature.
* VTK has a mechanism for passing 'information' along with a vtkDataSet. This may be useful, but may not be as visible in nature as adding new fields to our pipeline objects (avtDataAttributes, avtDataValidity, etc.) Vs reader sends a vtkInformation object for use by avtStaggeringFilter, as an example.

Some notes on what I found while trying to fix an issue with arb-poly mesh plots in conjunction with OnionPeel:
* The data was Silo
* Silo reader created avtOriginalCellNumbers (good)
* avtFacelistFilter created an avt3DCellNumbers array (this isn't related to arb-poly that I can tell).
* vtkLinesFromOriginalCells (used by avtMeshFilter) utilized the avt3DCellNumbers array to determine if edges should be kept or not.
* In the use-case of arb-poly data, the avt3DCellNumbers array was incorrect imho, as it treated each 'split' cell as unique. If Silo reader provided this array in the arb-poly case instead of avtFacelistFilter, then perhaps the Mesh plot would be a bit more accurate. 
* I added a 'zonesWereSplit' field to avtMeshMetaData to inform the pipeline that the database reader did cell splitting (as opposed to operators that may split zones).  This has the potential to be misunderstood or misused, and should probably be rethought.

The export_library_dependencies() command should not be called.

This command was added in January 2003 to export <tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS internal CMake cache entries to a file for installation with a project. This was used at the time to allow transitive link dependencies to work for applications outside of the original build tree of a project. The functionality has been superseded by the export() and install(EXPORT) commands.

CMake >= 3.0 prefer that this command never be called. The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR when the command is called.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0. CMake version 3.0.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

from customer's email:

visit_s.Nek5000 -> rofcavity0.f00001: single precision
visit.Nek5000 -> rs8cavity0.f00001 : double precision

These are same meshes by [0,1]x[0,1] but one is single  and the other double precision. When show the mesh with double precision, the scale of axis becomes to 10^36 on the begining.

It seems to me that the problem occurs when call function

avtNek5000FileFormat::GetBoundingBoxIntervalTree(int timestep)

in database/Nek5000/avtNek5000FileFormat.C.

In the function, for single precision 
""iFileSize == iFileSizeWithoutMetaData"", i.e.  the condition

...
      if (iFileSize < iFileSizeWithoutMetaData+iMDSize)
        {
            errorReadingData = 1;
            break;
        }
...
is satisfied and then break.

However for double precision,

iFileSize > iFileSizeWithoutMetaData+iMDSize

(since used sizeof(float) for iFileSizeWithoutMetaData!!)

So, the code continue to 

...
   for (ii = 0; ii < iNumBlocks; ii++)
    {
        double b[6];
        b[0] = (double)bounds[ii*6];
        b[1] = (double)bounds[ii*6+1];
        b[2] = (double)bounds[ii*6+2];
...

However ""bounds"" with float type to read 8bytes' double precision, this is why boundarybox becomes infinity.

Of course, we can change for double precision to
...
       boost::int64_t iFileSizeWithoutMetaData = 136 
                + sizeof(int)*aBlocksPerFile[ii] 
                + ((boost::int64_t)nFloatsPerDomain)*sizeof(double)*((boost::int64_t)aBlocksPerFile[ii]);

        boost::int64_t iMDSize = (nFloatsPerDomain * 2 * sizeof(double) * aBlocksPerFile[ii]) / 
                    (iBlockSize[0]*iBlockSize[1]*iBlockSize[2]);

and it works.

But I don't understand why we need the function because  the code stop in the line
...
     if (iFileSize < iFileSizeWithoutMetaData+iMDSize)
        {
            errorReadingData = 1;
            break;
        }

1)  don't check for crash-recovery files on Windows if you are running with command-line-options (like -o)
2)  Save and look for crash-recovery files in location where VisIt was launched (not %DOCUMENTS%/Visit). Since he launches VisIt by double-clicking on .visit files in different folders, this would prevent multiple instances of VisIt wanting to use the same crash-recovery file.

Option 2 gets tricky if VisIt thinks its launch location is the same as the install, or if user doesn't have write permissions for the launch location.

I pointed Al to the preference that turns off the feature, but he doesn't necessarily want to use that preference as he sometimes finds the crash recovery files to be useful.

Hi all,

I have been working on implementing HDF5 with XDMF as the new I/O for the code I use. I believe I have came across a bug in the VisIt XDMF Plug-in but I could be wrong.

Whenever a dimension of the data in the attribute matches the last dimension of the mesh in the grid it is on, VisIt views the attribute as an array. As an example, I have recreated the issue using explicit values given in XML, however this is the same issue as when I point to HDF5 datasets. In the below example (attached as well) the Attribute ""U"" is seen as an array in VisIt, since the last dimension of the mesh grid it is on, 9, is also a dimension of the Attribute. When this dimension matching does not occur however, everything works as expected, as in for the ""V"" attribute. 

I believe this is an issue in the VisIt plug-in because I could not cause this issue in p*r*view. I have used VisIt 2.9 and VisIt 2.7 and the same issue was present. If anyone has encountered this issue before or has an idea how to fix it, it would be greatly appreciated. Below is the example XDMF file that causes the error and the file information from VisIt.

Thank you,
Robert

VTK has quite a few xy-type plots:

* Scatter (curve plot with glyphed points instead of lines)
* Stacked (space-filled curves stacked on top of each other)
* Bar (like our histogram plot)
There is even a parallel coordinates plot.

Some notes on differences from our normal rendering pipeline:

Data for charts is stored in a vtkTable (instead of a vtkDataSet).
A vtkContextView is added to a vtkRenderer, and the chart instance is added to the vtkContextView. (Instead of vtkMapper/vtkActor pairs).

Would require changes within avt/Plotter at the very least.

changing the d2 expression to be 'd*cell_constant(mesh1, 100.0)' or even 'd*node_constant(mesh1, 100.0)', then the Scatter plot will work.

Now, swap the x and y coordinates for the Scatter plot: make X use the original d2 expression (d*100.), and make Y use 'u'.

So the failure when using the expression depends on whether or not it is considered the 'primary' variable in the pipeline.

Investigation revealed that the DataBinning operator is the 'terminal' netnode in the pipeline, so it's UpdateDataObjectInformation method is called after the same method for avtQueryOverTimeFilter.  This is bad due to DataBinning setting output topological dimension, which conflicts with the topological dimension needed by avtCurveConstructorFilter (and which is set properly by avtQueryOverTimeFilter).

If instead of using the operator-created-var route I create the plot like this:
    AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""pressure"")

Not sure what needs to change with how that query-over-time cloned pipeline is setup when operator-created-vars are in the mix.

 I attempted to update during the investigation of a fix for #2775.
On Linux, updating lead to problems with the Exodus reader.
On Windows, the update did not resolve #2775 (when compiled with VS 2013), so a different path was chosen.

The S3D and MFIXCDF readers would need to be updated to the newer NetCDF-c++ api.


During the upgrade, it should be determined if the addition of /STACK:400000 to windows builds of mdserver and engine executables can be removed (Test opening the data file from #2775).

here's some python code that accomplishes what is desired, but it would be great if it could just be added to the python atts class for Volume plot.

<pre>
# Grab the control points list from the desired color table, ""Reds"" here 
redsct = GetColorTable(""Reds"")

# Grab the Volume plot attributes, and clear out the color control points 
va = VolumeAttributes()
va.colorControlPoints.ClearControlPoints()
