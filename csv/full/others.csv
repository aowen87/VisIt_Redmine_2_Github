2505,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,Normal,Thresholding scatter plots from curve data (from csv file),Kevin Griffin,"",2.13.1,Jim Eliot,01/11/2016,"",100,"",01/11/2016 04:23 am,02/13/2018 12:59 pm,3 - Occasional,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,2.10.0,"","",All,Any,"When using the threshold operator with a scatter plot created from curve data (from a csv file), using the 'Zones from input' option gives weird results.

Here is how I can reproduce the issue:

- The source data is a csv file with three columns that correspond to x_coordinate, y_coordinate and a value.
- I open the csv file using the Plaintext reader. I DO NOT use the option to specify columns 0 and 1 as the x and y coordinates.
- I then create an expression called 'unnamed1' with Definition 'var02'. This will be used for thresholding.
- I create a scatter plot using var00 and var01 as x and y, and var02 as the Color Variable.
- I then apply a threshold operator using the scalar 'unnamed1'.
- When applying the threshold operator, there is an option to output mesh as 'Zones from input' or 'Point mesh'.
  - When using the 'Zones from input' option, the threshold operator outputs weird results.
  - Changing the output to 'Point mesh' gives expected results.

When opening the file, if I use the options of the Plaintext reader to specify that columns 0 and 1 are the x and y coordinates, VisIt creates a point mesh and the thresholding works fine with both threshold output options ('Zones from input' or 'Point mesh').

- I have created a simple .csv file and .session file that reproduces the issue.
- The .session file contains two plots, one that thresholds using 'Zones from input' the other using 'Point mesh'.
- The thresholded plots are different


Having to tick the 'Point Mesh' button in the threshold dialog is not a big deal, but I have encountered some plots where the incorrect method has been used without realising that the output was wrong."

The seedme.py module is NOT installed from VisIt 2.12.1 onwards on all platforms builds. This breaks the SeedMe widget and corresponding functionality.
I see that the requests module which is needed by SeedMe is installed, so I suspect something goes wrong in the build process.

I verified missing module by inspecting the following paths on builds 
Linux: visit/2.12.X/linux-x86_64/lib/python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ 
Mac: /Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/2.12.X/darwin-x86_64/lib/python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ 
Windows: C:/Program Files/LLNL/VisIt 2.12.X/lib/python/lib/site-packages/

In my personal linux build for 2.12.1 the SeedMe module was built correctly. So seems like the pre packed build has some issue.

2672,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,High,No parallel hardware acceleration with existing X servers,Mark Miller,"",2.12.0,John Plate,08/30/2016,"",0,"",08/30/2016 11:45 am,10/25/2016 01:44 pm,5 - Always,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,2.10.3,"","",Linux,Any,"It is not possible to get parallel hardware acceleration with existing X servers.

The bug is in the file engine/main/XDisplay.C in function XDisplay::Initialize:
[...]
    //updated: enabling new logic
    if(!this->launch || (this->xserver = xinit(this->display, user_args)) == -1)

The ""new logic"" causes the function to fail if no X server should be launched or if the X server fails to launch. The ""old logic"" caused the function to fail if a X server should be launched and it fails.

So this function always fails when existing X servers should be used. This causes that no attempt is made to connect to the display server, see function Engine::SetupDisplay in engine/main/Engine.C. As a result, the parallel engine fails or falls back to software rendering.

My tests with the ""old logic"" were successful, so I propose to simply revoke the ""new logic"".

VisIt engine cannot connect back to viewer, if login-node is known by different names and IPs for external connections (clients) and internal connections (compute nodes).

The problem has been discussed on the ""VisIt - User Mailing List"" and Brad suggested a fix:
https://elist.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-users/2015-October/017961.html
This fix works perfect on the JUQUEEN and I hope it can become part of the official VisIt release.

It introduces the command line argument ""-socket-bridge-host"" to set the socket bridge host instead of using ""gethostname(""localhost"").

Attached you find the implementation in common/comm/LaunchService.C for VisIt version 2.9.2.
It works fine on the BlueGene/Q JUQUEEN at Juelich Research Centre in Germany.

I came across a problem using libsimV2+Fortran+visitgetenv().

It is about the line 427 in visitfortransimV2interface.c:
    sz = (len < *lenv) ? (sz - 1) : (*lenv - 1);

IMHO, it should look like this:
    sz = (len < *lenv) ? (len) : (sz - 1);


From Fortran I call visitgetenv() like this:
      character(len=4096) :: env
      integer :: env_len = 4096
      if (mpi_proc_id == 0) then
        ierr = visItGetEnv(env,env_len); CHKWARN1(ierr, VISIT_OKAY)
      end if  

Hence, it has to ensured, that the string written to env must not be larger than env_len.   
In  visitgetenv() the string to copy is 'src' and its length 'len'.

=> if 'len' is smaller than '*lenv', we can use memcpy to fill 'env'.
else we should not copy anything to 'env'.

Best,
Jens Henrik

Not surprisingly, the output after removing nodal values is wrong as can be seen by comparing with the output produced by 2.7.x. Curiously, the same problem does not seem to happen with the corresponding VTK file (also attached).

Severity: Affects those among the several hundred deal.II users that use VisIt (~50%).

Even if I add the invert option manually in the .session file or .xml file and reload in visit, invert option is ignored.

I tried this in VisIt 2.8.1, 2.71., 2.5.2, another user confirmed this problem with 2.9.0 Beta

Steps to reproduce
1) Open noise.silo
2) Add contour plot to any variable
3) Open Contour plot setting, check invert Color table option.
4) Save Session
5) Now Restore this session, the invert option is not there. Confirms invert option was not written 

6) Hack the session file and add the following below the Color Table option
<Field name=""invertColorTable"" type=""bool"">true</Field>
7) Restore again from session, the invert option is still not there. Confirms invert option is ignored 

You could do the same with saving contour properties and XML. The invert option gets ignored, even if you add that by hand. 
The read parser and write factory are ignoring invert property

This can be demonstrated with the global_node.silo test dataset by applying the OnionPeel operator with a global id seed to a Filled Boundary Plot or a Mesh Plot

To reproduce:

  OpenDatabase(""global_node.silo"", 0)
  AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""p"", 1, 1)
  AddPlot(""FilledBoundary"", ""mat"", 1, 1)
  AddPlot(""Mesh"", ""mesh"", 1, 1)
    #
  SetActivePlots((0, 1, 2))
  AddOperator(""OnionPeel"", 1)
  OnionPeelAtts = OnionPeelAttributes()
  OnionPeelAtts.adjacencyType = OnionPeelAtts.Node
  OnionPeelAtts.useGlobalId = 1
  OnionPeelAtts.index = (2000) # (or whatever)
  OnionPeelAtts.seedType = OnionPeelAtts.SeedCell
  SetOperatorOptions(OnionPeelAtts, 1)
    #
  DrawPlots()
  SaveWindow()
  

You will see that the selected Pseudocolor cell is in the right place but the Filled Boundary and Mesh cell is not at the seed specified. In serial you will see two highlighted cells â€“ the correct Pseudocolor one and the Filled Boundary/Mesh cell which looks as if it is at cell 0 of the first processor domain. Note also that the result you get seems to depend on how many processors you use with the multi-domain dataset e.g. with -np 16 processors specified you get cell 0 on each of the first(?) 16 processors displayed.
The Operator seems to work as required in VisIt 2.7.0 but not in VisIt 2.7.1.
  
So we suspect this may be related to the changes made to avtOnionPeelFilter.C at revisions 22330 and 22332 which follow on from Bug #1645"

Note that I indeed don't have DISPLAY set, as this is (intentionally) remotely, using ""ssh -x"". This is intentional because eventually this should run in the background without DISPLAY as well.

If I try the same with correct DISPLAY set this succeeds. Actually doing something however is very slow, as this is a slow, remote connection and visit seems to be using the local (local to me) DISPLAY for something.

What I would expect instead is that visit doesn't touch DISPLAY if -nowin is given. No window should be created (and none is, if DISPLAY is set). This would enable remote/background renderings.

Seems it's missing -lQtCore, with libQtCore added the test compile succeeds:

paulm@v40-5:/opt/compiles/visit-2.6.3/silo-4.9.1$ g++ -o ax_qt_main ax_qt_main.o moc_ax_qt_test.o -L/opt/compiles/visit-2.6.3/visit/qt/4.8.3/linux-x86_64_gcc-4.7/lib -lQtCore -lQtGui  -lSM -lICE  -lX11 -lXext -lXmu -lXt -lXi  -lz

So I guess adding -lQtCore in the right place would fix that part of the problem.


However, I would expect a second run of the build_visit script (without fixing the Silo configuration) to again produce the Silo configuration error, but to my surpise Silo now gets configured without Qt:

While double-clicking the VisIt.app bundle in finder opens the gui correctly, 
trying to launch VisIt via the terminal commands

  open /Applications/VisIt.app
open -a VisIt

has no effect.

The reason is that my platform is incorrectly identified as @darwin-i386@,
as revealed by

  /Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/frontendlauncher
Version 2.6.2 of gui does not exist for the architecture darwin-i386.

This error message also appears, when trying to launch the command-line interface from within the gui, which makes this problem a bit more serious.

The culprit is found in the @internallauncher@ script (lines 1860 and beyond) located in @/Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/2.6.2/bin@.

The script uses the output of @uname -a@ to determine the architecture of the system. On my Macbook Pro, the output from @uname -a@ is

  Darwin ddm03588.empa.emp-eaw.ch 12.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 12.3.0: Sun Jan  6 22:37:10 PST 2013; root:xnu-2050.22.13~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 i386 MacBookPro10,1 Darwin

so the variable @all_uname[-1]@ contains @darwin@ instead of @x86_64@, leading the script to the assumption that my architecture only supports @i386@.


This problem may be solved by searching for @x86_64@ in the output of @uname -a@ instead of assuming that it must be at the last position. For example using the @string@ module:

  #if all_uname[-1] == ""x86_64"":
if string.find(self.uname(""-a""), 'x86_64') != -1:

The correct behavior would be to have no warning, as zonal variable data logically could be associated with only the internal cells, and not necessarily the boundary elements.  TecPlot does not have this issue and can plot these data sets correctly.

Molecule:  ()

Jeremy then suggested adding the 'External Surface' operator beforehand, which resolves the problem.

However, as a user I would not have found out about this by myself and maybe you could automatize the underlying process such that I only need to apply the CreateBonds operator.

P.S. - Out of a foolish consistency, I would suggest editting signalhandler_core in src/common/misc/DebugStreamFull.C to say ""SIGABRT"" instead of ""SIGBRT""...

P.P.S. - During these tests, I noticed that there is no <FilePatterns> section in FLASH.xml, so that there is no way to auto-recognize FLASH files by extension.  This might be intended, since the FLASH program does not, by default append an extension...  "

I'm not sure what the advantage of having two or more entries is, as earlier matches in the PATH string shadow later ones. The only situation where a match in the 2.0.1 directory would occur would be if an executable was installed there in that version but not any later version. If such a match did occur, the user wouldn't necessarily know which executable was selected. That's a relatively rare occurrence, but if it does happen, it's likely not what the user intended.


It looks like an older version could block a newer one if the older version were installed more recently. I don't know how common that situation is, though.

An option to remove all other VisIt entries from the PATH when installing might prevent potential confusion.

It is also possible to explore through the time dimension using the animation controls.  However, interactively exploring through other dimensions is difficult.

In my case, I have mesh data with scalar variables set upon mesh elements.  I want to be able to explore this data by displaying only those elements for which a scalar variable T takes on values in [n,m].  I can do this by using the Threshold operator, but this operator requires me to type in values for n and m, and retype the values if I want to change them.  It's a cumbersome process if I want to vary the threshold quickly.

The process could be improved by allowing the lower and upper bound settings of the threshold operator to be controlled by sliders.  Note that a special case exists when the user wants to see data taking on exactly one discrete value (i.e. when n=m).  In this case, it may be desirable to have a single interactive slider to control the value of the threshold.

The errors suggest that the actual script filtermovie.py can not even be found, but the traceback suggests that the main cause of the problem is that the filter_mover.py module can not be found.

A work-around is to add the current directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable: (for (t)csh):
$ setenv PYTHONPATH $PWD
or
$ setenv PYTHONPATH ""$PWD:$PYTHONPATH""
(first case when PYTHONPATH is not already defined, the second when it is)
For bash it will be something similar with the 'export' command.

Even though a work-around is available, this problem should be dealt with by the makemovie script

1.
Suppose I have written a script that explicitly sets the directory for output when calling SaveWindow():

swa.outputToCurrentDirectory = False
swa.outputDirectory = ""some/dir""

Now when this script is ran with 'visit -movie', the frames will be written to 'some/dir', yet the makemovie.py script doesn't notice. It just creates a directory [outputname]-# (with outputname defaulting to 'movie') and after rendering all frames, it calls ffmpeg with -i [outputname]-#/mpeg_link%04d.format  (with format the extension corresponding to swa.format - this attribute IS correctly passed on)
There are two problems here: 
- the filename mismatches (I didn't do anything do it, so frames called 'some/dir/visit%04d.format' where created)
- it's the wrong directory

Clearly ffmpeg will fail, with:
/path/to/script/movie-0/mpeg_link%04d.jpeg: No such file or directory

2.
So let's leave everything to default and run the script:
- still all output files are created in the current directory, instead of the [outputname]-#/ directory
Hence, again: the ffmpeg will fail, which is again directed to files [outputname]-#/mpeg_link%04d.format

At this point it looks fine since it's using local hardware rendering - the imposters have correct z values when they intersect each other.  If you change it to always use scalable rendering, you get the old impostors that are just 2d billboards that stack over each other instead of intersecting correctly.

This bug seems to only appear when using scalable rendering with localhost on windows.  Using a windows client with linux compute nodes appears to work correctly, and linux with localhost SR also seem to work.

I think it could be useful to add a tool allowing to do so within VisIt. The idea I have in mind, is to add an operator that can create the a curve out of the different isosurfaces previously defined. If there are multiple isosurfaces the operator may create multiple curves as well.

The reference points used to calculate the distace could be highlighted by putting a dot or something like that on the isosurfaces.

At the very least it is confusing and annoying. Here are the steps to reproduce:
- Create a very simple script, something like:
import visit
def any_event(*args):
&gt;&gt;print ""VisIt callback "" + args[-1]

events = ['PseudocolorAttributes', 'MeshAttributes'] # add any *Attributes you want for Plot-plugins
for e in events:
&gt;&gt;visit.RegisterCallback(e, any_event, e)

visit.OpenGUI()

Now create a plot of the type you registered, eg a Mesh-plot of some dataset. Now try to change the attributes through the GUI. Two things can happen:
 - you just change something - immediately an event is generated with the new set of attributes and the callback function is activated. However, the actual new set of Attributes is NOT applied to the plot.
   In other words: the callback-function would have to do this.
 - hit 'Apply' - this will result in yet another *Attributes event, activating the callback function. But this time the set of Attributes IS applied. The callback-function doesn't have to do it again.

My problem is that inside the callback function it is impossible to find out which of the above cases caused the function to run (well..... maybe there is a way through some more global attributes - that would be a solution to this bug) Hence the callback function can't tell if there is a need to explicitly set the attributes it received. It is not a big issue, but it is quite different from the *Attributes from the Operator-plugins for which only events are generated upon clicking the 'Apply'-button. IMHO the latter is to be preferred."

This breaks the above standard naming convention, which is quite irritating when looping over plugins.

The same problem appears for the corresponding callback-event. According to the OperatorPlugins()-list one should expect an 'SmoothAttributes'-event, but instead one gets a 'SmoothOperatorAttributes'-event.

I guess there are two ways to solve the issue: either rename the name of the plugin to 'SmoothOperator' or rename the corresponding Attributes-function and event to SmoothAttributes (which IMHO would be preferable, because that is more in line with the naming convention used for the other plugins)

In a pseudocolor plot, when a data contain both positive and negative values, I would like to specify the color of value zero.  For example, I want to plot zero as white, positive values as blue, and negative values as red (with different shades of blue/red for varying values of the data).

One way to achieve this is to set data limit min/max such that min = -max.  Then use a color table that has a color gradient red-white-blue.  The drawback of this approach is that I have to manually set min/max.  I might not know these values before hand.  

In pseudocolor plot's attributes, it would be nice to be able to automatically set the data limits such that min = -max.  For example, if the data is in range  -3.4 ... 5.2, then visit set the data limits as min = -5.2 and max = 5.2.  This would solve the problem mentioned above.

Here is one possible user interface.  I realize that it is more cluttered than before.  Someone might be able to come up with a simpler UI.

Perhaps â€˜material_namesâ€™ as a non-cell/non-point associated FIELD  array (stored before the POINTS or COORDINATE arrays in an ascii vtk file).
 
We would need to know how to associate with material â€˜idâ€™.  I donâ€™t think we should assume that materials idâ€™s start with 0 and increase incrementally by 1 J  So we would probably need another array that associates material_names index with material â€˜idâ€™.

Is there a way to specify a material in a VTK file for VisIt?  I am writing a scalar to a vtk file that is properly interpreted as an integer where each value has a meaning which fits the notion of ""material"" well, even though it isn't. Right now I just make it a scalar field.

    On my keyboard at least, I can get mu by typing the right hand AltGr and m
        -> µ

    This character can either be:

    3a) Typed directly into the Text field of an Annotation Object.

      or:

    3b) Typed into a script.
        (Note however that you then also need to put a special encoding comment
        into the top of the script so that the Python pre-processor will 
        interpret the source file correctly.)

      # -*- coding: latin-1 -*-
        ...
      TxtM2D = CreateAnnotationObject(""Text2D"")
      TxtM2D.text = ""size 10µm""


With the newer versions of VisIt (2.7.0 onwards), whatever method you use,
the special character just seems to get filtered out and the string closes up.

(With a future development version, the whole string seems to disappear if a
special character is found in it)

We are wondering if the ability was lost with the move to VTK 6.0.
(Could it be as simple a some extra configuration flag ?)

Hi  Burlen,

It runs visit in â€œ-diffâ€ mode & relies on some paths that wouldnâ€™t work for out of source builds. 

Because it was an odd test --  when I switched the test suite to python it didnâ€™t fully survive. I am sure we could resurrect it.

 However, the â€œ-diffâ€ mode really just leverages a fancy python script.  I have long felt we should support what it does as part of the main visit python module.

The build passes, but crashes at runtime with OpenMPI, despite compiled with OpenMPI wrappers using --parallel. This issue is described in ParallelPorting on the Wiki, but is kind of confusing given the automatic option --parallel.

For me it takes quite a while to build VisIt on my local machine (even longer for the cluster), and it would have saved me a lot of time both compiling (once instead of twice) and investigating, if the build_script checked if I had OpenMPI and added the following missing lines to begin with:

VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT(VISIT_MPI_C_FLAGS ""-DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX"")
VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT(VISIT_MPI_CXX_FLAGS ""-DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX"")

OpenMPI comes with the ompi_info utility, stored in the same directory as mpicc (seemingly by convention, confirmed both on Mac and Linux), which could be used as one indicator of whether the MPI setup warrants the additional lines in the cmake site configuration. By using the same path as the current mpicc, it would also be more likely that the existence of the ompi_util is not a false positive, found elsewhere but not related to the active mpicc.

It might be nasty of me to call this a bug, but I believe some simple heuristics in the build script could save many of us mere mortals a lot of time in the future."

We use tetrahedral meshes (only tetrahedral), thus we store our data as such:
Vertices: {x,y,z,x,y,z,...}
Tetrahedrons/connections: {v1,v2,v3,v4,v1,v2,v3,v4,...}

VisIt wants VISIT_CELL_TET for every set of four tetrahedrons causing either an overhead of N/4 elements.

There are two options to get around this:
- What we currently do: copy the connections and att VISIT_CELL_TET where needed (introduces a memory overhead)
- Modify our internal representation of the connections to fit VisIt (would make our simulation code platform-dependent and introduces a slight memory overhead)

My guess is that meshes of mixed geometries are far more rare than meshes of only one geometry.

The ideal solution would allow for both mixed geometries and passing a list (such as our list of connections described above) and a single VISIT_CELL_TET passed in a separate variable, which would solve the issues with both options above.

As Brad Whitlock suggests, doing this internally might be a solution, but it would also mask the overhead to the end user. Another option, if possible, would be to implement this in VisIt as well, to truly allow for the connectivity to be passed without memory overhead.

Internally VisIt is probably running an busy-wait loop and to test for new input.

2442,Pending,VisIt,Bug,Normal,LibsimV2 Fortran-interface is missing hidden arguments,"","","",Jens Henrik Goebbert,11/02/2015,"",0,"",11/02/2015 11:06 am,11/03/2015 07:00 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,trunk,"","",All,Any,"Hi everyone,

if one calls a C-function from Fortran and it includes a CHARACTER argument
Fortran will call that function with an additional hidden argument for the length of the CHARACTER at the end of the argument list
(as long as you are not using BIND(C), which is part of Fortran2003).
Example:
  CHARACTER(len=64) :: name = ""foo""
  INTEGER :: arg2, arg3
  [...]
  call foo_C_function(name, arg2, arg3)
Required function definition in C-lib:
  void foo_C_function(char* name, int* arg2, int* arg3, int name_f77len)

Currently this is not considered in the VisIt Fortran interface.
Hence, with each function call from Fortran to VisIt an additional int is written to the stack, which is not expected. 
This can lead to unexpected errors, which are hard to track.

It can be solved for all functions defined in visitfortransimV2interface.c easily.
I attached a fix, which works fine for me. It changes all function definitions expecting on or more CHARACTER arguments in Fortran.
Example:

FORTRAN
F_VISITSETDIRECTORY(VISIT_F77STRING dir, VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN(dir) int *ldir VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN(dir))

with VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN and VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN defined in VisItFortran.h like this:

#ifdef USE_VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN
#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN(a)   ,int a ## _f77hiddenlen
#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN_DECL ,int
#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN(a)
#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN_DECL
#else
#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN(a)
#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN_DECL
#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN(a)     ,int a ## _f77hiddenlen
#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN_DECL   ,int

This is the common approach for Fortran77 interfaces you can find for example in MPICH:
http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/repos/snowflock/mpich-1.2.7/mpid/ch_nt/nt_ipvishm/include/mpidefs.h
 MPI_GET_PROCESSOR_NAME( char * FORT_MIXED_LEN_DECL, MPI_Fint *, MPI_Fint * FORT_END_LEN_DECL );
http://sourcecodebrowser.com/mpich2/1.2.1/mpi__fortimpl_8h_source.html
 #define FORT_MIXED_LEN_DECL, #define FORT_END_LEN_DECL

more:
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Argument-passing-conventions.html
 * Microsoft Fortran adds the argument not at the end, but just after the CHARACTER arg - hence, FORT_MIXED_LEN_* is also provided, but just for completeness."

There are no obvious clues in the -debug logs perhaps because it fails so quickly (SocketLostConnectionException).
 
Use-case: Comparing an experimental image on a local machine with the results of a simulation on a supercomputer.

If both datasets are on the same machine it will work.
A Save Window using the Screen-Capture option will also generally work.

Further debugging hints at the problem being caused by a NULL ZBuffer.
(/null pointer dereference)

avtWholeImageCompositeWithZ::Execute

One of the images (presumably the remote one) has a NULL ZBuffer.

Further investigation suggests that the problem is related to a couple of previously reported bugs:

VisIt Bug #180
""SR mode with local geometry crashes after save window""

  and
VisIt Bug #639

See these for further details.


Problem found in VisIt 2.10.2, (and 2.10.3) and there also appear to be related problems in previous versions.

I am playing around with the idea of of converting our internal code data format to Xdmf. However, before touching the code, I generated a very simple XDMF grid split up by parts. Visit does not seem to respect the part names and just names them blockxxxx. I loaded the same file into Paraview, and it seemed to read it just fine. Any help would be appreciated. 

Thank you!

3158,Pending,VisIt,Bug,Normal,Slow reading of CarpetIOHDF5 data in visit 2.13,Mark Miller,"","",Yosef Zlochower,06/12/2018,"",0,"",06/12/2018 11:50 am,06/19/2018 07:00 pm,3 - Occasional,3 - Major Irritation,2.13.0,"","",Linux,Any,"  I was trying to load CarpetIOHDF5 2D data with visit 2.10 and 2.13. I compiled both on an SL7 box using the build_visit scripts with the --hdf5 option. The 2.13 takes much longer to load.

I loaded up files containing 3,4,5,6,7, 10, and 13 timelevels, respectively. I then measured the time it took from hitting the ""OK"" button of the open file dialog until the main window responded. Here's what I found.

For 2.10.3, it takes about a second to open any of the files.

For 2.13 the time seems to increase at least quadratically with  the number of timelevels

# timelevels   #time to load in seconds
3             5
4             9
5             15
6             25
7             38
10            114
13            220

Any ideas of what could be happening? While I am using the CarpetIOHDF5 data format, these are 2d data sets.

I ran these tests using a Scientific Linux 7 box, but first noticed the problem on a windows 10 machine using the precompiled binaries available on the visit website.

I have data sets that can be used to show the slowdown, but they exceed the 5MB upload limit. You can download them at
