To fix we need to add something like the following (from the Axom project) to the config line:

NOTE: This also undermines silo.

I know we have talked about this in depth before (http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Pseudocolor_rendering_of_nodal_variables_on_quads)

Tom Brunner has a case with dendritic zones where this rendering issue making it hard to debug issues in their code.

He suggested if we had an option, similar to the last option on the page above that used the average value at the nodes for the center point of the triangle that would help.  Did we try the average value, or did we try actually interpolating to select a value for that point?

I have found a bug in Visit (2.12.3) with Silo files in a time sequence.
I am attaching two time states with (parallel: 2 files per time step + 1 header--> 6 silo files total).

These are generated using Libsim.

There are two issues (after loading both time states: pseudocolor->rho): 
1.) When you move to the second time step, the surface is not completely rendered. 
     If you hit Reopen and Draw, the surface fully appears.

2.) If you Reopened on the second time step, then go back to the first time step, an error throws:
Pseudocolor: ()
viewer: Tried to access 97 of 97.

These two issues are quite common (particularly the second one) with the Silo extracts from Libsim.

    Hello,
    
    I have noticed that there is now a requirement for lapack,
    in order to build Uintah with the lastest visit, but lapack
    is not built as part of the visit build script. Can lapack be
    added to the build script with a --lapack flag so that 
    Uintah will build correctly.

h5cc is in the default path on several platforms,  (including LLNL's LC platforms) so tpls using CMake's FindHDF5 support will always find the wrong hdf5 libs.


changing bv_hdf5 back to install everything fixes the problem  -- the cmake logic finds h5cc for our install and uses it.

I found some more problems with the build_visit script when trying to have Damaris installed. I listed the changes to make here. If you could commit the corrections for the next release (hopefully so that people attending the SC tutorial have a working version), it would be great:

- in the bv_support/bv_damaris.sh file, the DAMARIS_URL should be changed as follows:
export DAMARIS_URL=${DAMARIS_URL:-""https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/35204""}
- in the bv_support/bv_xercesc.sh file the XERCESC_URL should be changed as well as follows:
export XERCESC_URL=${XERCESC_URL:-""http://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/c/3/sources""}

Also when the build_visit script defaults to searching in the VisIt website for the third-party libraries, there are 2 issues:
- Xerces-C is missing, as pointed out in my previous mail. You can find it here: http://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.1.2.tar.gz
- XSD is missing, you can find it here: http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/xsd/4.0/xsd-4.0.0+dep.tar.bz2
- The archive damaris-1.0.1.tgz is incorrect, it contains damaris-1.0. So it should be replaced with https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/35204/damaris-1.0.1.tgz

I don't know if you have a policy behind hosting some third-party dependencies and not other, I see that boost is also no here. Here the problem is mainly with XercesC, which has changed location since the build_visit script was made. Hopefully it doesn't change anymore.

Thanks a lot!

We have a bug in the MFEM/VisIt integration that prevents us from visualizing high-order Nedelec elements on tet meshes. 

Cyrus: the problem is in line 462 of VisIt’s src/databases/MFEM/avtMFEMFileFormat.C.

Can you switch
   mesh = new Mesh(imesh, 1, 1);
to
   mesh = new Mesh(imesh, 1, 1, false);

The fix_orientation argument is true by default in this constructor, because it makes sense when we use the mesh for discretization. For visualization, this is actually wrong in the high-order Nedelec case.

One more request for the next VisIt release :)

I might have mentioned this previously, but we rely on short URL links as the main way to track MFEM downloads. This is important for us during project reviews and when writing funding proposals.

Do you mind changing 

svn_bin/bv_support/bv_mfem.sh

to use our short URLs instead of directly grabbing the files from mfem.github.io/releases? This is what’s done for example in spack and homebrew/science:

https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/mfem/package.py
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pull/3530/commits/2a2549783607af45641c8c82540b26f383e3970a

I’ll be happy to send you the list of the short URLs for the different MFEM versions, or you can grab them directly from http://mfem.org/download.

Please let me know if we can be of any assistance with this. Thank you in advance for your help!

Hi all,

I'm currently compiling VisIt for use on Ubuntu 15.10 and I want to use the system python. It seems as though there is an improvement that can be made to the build_visit script so that it successfully finds the python library dir:

On line 14708, we can change:
    PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR=""${VISIT_PYTHON_DIR}/lib""
to:
    PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR=`""$PYTHON_CONFIG_COMMAND"" --configdir`

I believe this should be cross platform, but don't have other machines to test it with.

Cheers,
Brett

Hi Cyrus,

Here is an archive with the files to add/modify in the VisIt SVN repository to get Damaris to be compiled along with VisIt. There is also a README file indicating what each file does or how it was modified from its original version.

Note: when using --tarball instead of SVN, Damaris will uncompress the VisIt tarball to find the libsim headers. When the script finally builds VisIt, the same folder will be uncompressed again (I see in the script that it doesn't check for an existing ""visit2.9.0"" folder, I don't know if it's intentional, so I left it as it is).

Let me know if you have any question and keep me posted on the integration!

I have given you a file on the rz that demonstrates a bug in the visit
onion peel operator.

 It is a 3D polyhedral mesh (even though all the elements are really hexes).

If I plot

1. material filled boundary (ThreeD_Unstructured)
2. mesh (ThreeD_Unstructured)
3. subset of domains (ThreeD_Unstructured) (wireframe)

then apply operator to all plots

onion peel:
set: domain4
seed: 489
layers: 0

You will see that the material filled boundary plot gets the correct
zone, but the mesh and domain plot get the incorrect zone.

I think this is because visit in converting the hexes into 24 tets, so
the indexing is incorrect.

(Cyrus has the files on RZ.)

She has a silo file with 3 multi-meshes.

When she plots one of the two meshes that don't have dbis -- she gets this message:


Mesh()
viewer: engine_par: avtStructuredDomainBoundries:: targetted  domain more than number of domains.

(note the misspelling targetted is in the error message, so that should help us find it quickly)


In this case the meshes that don't correspond to the dbi have more domains than the other mesh does -- this is not common, typically the meshes with dbi have largest domain count.

So I think this is an obvious bug that simply have not stumbled upon yet.  The sanity check is prevent us from creating the plot, when the dbis should just be ignored.

I had some troubles building the latest VisIt on our Gentoo boxes.
Please find attached a patch to the build_visit2_6_2 script. Summary:
include/lib paths on Gentoo are different and we need to link against
libm, libQtGui, libQtCore. I'm building with:

export PAR_INCLUDE=""-I/opt/openmpi/include""
export PAR_LIBS=`mpicc --showme:link -lmpi_cxx`
export VISITDIR=/opt/visit

./build_${VISIT_PACKAGE} --makeflags '--jobs=8' --console --no-thirdparty --hdf5 --mesa --parallel --silo --szip --vtk --python --system-qt --system-cmake

Please note that ""export PAR_INCLUDE=`mpicc --showme:compile"" won't
work as parsing of that variable in build_icet() is broken. Would it
work if one grabbed all include paths there?

The error does not occur when force single is on and appeared with the release of VisIt 2.5.

----
Hey Cyrus,

I have given you two tarballs on RZ containing dumps of problems with
periodic boundaries.  The file one_domain.tar contains a 3D problem with a
single domain and all faces periodic. The file for_cyrush.tar contains a
coarse version of Britton's problem, which is a 3D problem with x and y
dimensions periodic (run with 12 domains on 12 processes).

In the root file in the Decomposition directory, I have added two int
vectors:

PeriodicDomList
PeriodicBndList

As discussed yesterday, these two vectors together identify each periodic
boundary. Let me know if you need anything else from me.


Thanks,

Brandon

at this time pip has too much complexity with the env and flags necessary to gain control over pip's build int smarts (which undermine us)
we have a simpler solution:

1) Hari will modify build_visit to use a setup.py approach to build:
mpi4py (if parallel is enabled)
r2py (if r support is enabled)
numpy

these will be installed to {build_visit_path}/py-site-packages
so they don't pollute the python install (or a system python)
he will create a summary (most likely passed in the  config-site file) of these package and their tarballs that can be used in VisIt's CMake Proper if a make install is necessary.
 
2) Cyrus will work on cmake logic to support the ""make install"" case for these packages

we already have logic to handle our own setup.py , so we should be able to extend this. 

if there are still abs path issues, 
we may also need to use visit-install

Hi,

gcc 4.9 gives me a warning for line 1252 in tools/xdmf_writer/xdmf_writer.c

From my understanding the compiler is right as:

struct timeval times[8];
...
int nBytes = 8 * sizeof(struct timeval);
...
for (i = 0; i < nBytes; i++)
         allTimes[i] = times[i];
...

so the loop should only go from 0 to 8 but it goes to nBytes which is
8*sizeof(timeval)....

Cheers,
Cihan

Hi Cihan,

Yes, that looks like a bug -- if we want to copy the bytes directly, we would need to use a different pointer type than timeval * (we could use char *)

Turns out by simply linking with manta, this installs a handler that ends up nesting a manta call to exit() in any other exit call.
The manta logical will call exit with 0, superseding whatever value was passed.

I see two issues here:
*we shouldn't link manta to the cli, or gui

Hi folks-
 I have some students using VisIt 2.10.0 from the current binary install on Mac OS X.  If they try to produce an mpeg animation, VisIt errors out after producing the initial frames with a message about mpeg2encode being called with the wrong suffix (.mpg instead of .m2v?)
 Is there a preferred free movie encoder for Macs?  Should everyone just install ffmpeg?

VisIt advances 3 or 4 time steps, I get the error:

Note from William Jones, NASA:

Typical CFD workflow involves dealing a lot with surfaces in conjunction with the volume or field data.  We want to access both the surfaces of the object of interest (wing, fuselage, flap, vertical tail, etc.) along flow features (streamlines, vortex cores, etc) in the same plot.

To facilitate this, many CFD file formats include boundary information along with the volumetric data.  For unstructured meshes, the boundary condition surfaces are typically exposed as collections of boundary cell faces (2D topology) along with the volume cells (3D topology) for each mesh.  These are not separate meshes as they reference the same points as the volume cells (points are a single list of coordinates and solution data).  They simply provide additional connectivity and are actually faces of the volume cells.  We rely on these to render and distinguish the most significant portions of the domain, the surface (again wing, fuselage, vertical tail, flap, etc).  However, we also may need to combine these plots with a volume plot (slices, streamlines around the geometry, etc).

How might this surface information best be conveyed to VisIt?  It would appear that subsets would accomplish this best.  Would one combine the 2D and 3D cells in a single mesh and assign different materials applied to the boundary collections so that they could be subsets?  Would the combination of 2D and 3D cells in a single mesh cause problems with VisIt (avtMeshMetaData defines a single topological dimension)?

As and example, the common practice for unstructured zones in CGNS is to define additional Elements_t nodes that define the boundary face cell collections and assign boundary conditions to them (sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 of the CGNS User's Guide 3.1.3).  I understand that these additional /sections/ are ignored by the VisIt CGNS plugin. Unfortunately, it makes use of CGNS files in VisIt quite difficult for practitioners who are used to the common CFD workflow.  I have looked at the source for this plugin, but do not think that I am experienced enough with VisIt to properly expose these additional entities.  Is it possible that someone more knowledgeable would have time to look at it?  Maybe materials are not the best way to subset.  I entertain all other suggestions. "

They fact that he is using history variables complicates things.
We can get the value on a separate mesh without volume fractions, or we can get the value on the full mesh though forced material interface reconstruction. In this case the resulting MIR volumes could be the source of error. 

Cyrus is going to dig deeper on this.

One tool I wish was available:
Pull the values out on the entire mesh with out MIR. 
For this case, we can set 0 as the default value for portions of the mesh that do not have values.

FITS files.  If this is checked, they won't open.  I guess maybe there
is some missing functionality in the plugin?  (it would be nice if it
would read time/cycle and domain extents for FITS files, but I suspect
nobody has put this in the plugin).

Here is the email chain that spawned this ticket:

--
Hi Everyone,
I am doing some builds with icc and auditing build_visit for the proper behavior.
(By this i mean actually using icc and passing the flags I selected.)

I discovered that --cflags & --cxxflags options add to C_OPT_FLAGS and CXX_OPT_FLAGS and I found this a bit odd. I expected them to be appended to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

Looking futher, I found these (X_OPT...) aren't getting passed to some thirdparty libs.

I thought C_OPT_FLAGS and CXX_OPT_FLAGS were reserved for flags we wanted to use when --release was selected (note this should also be the default)


In an ideal world, bv_thirdparty.sh should only care about *one* set of flags from bv_main, to avoid omission of important options.
It would be great to simplify things, but I think that is a larger surgery than I want to perform right now on build_visit.

Anyone have any opinions on this front?

-Cyrus


---
Hi Cyrus,

My primary thoughts are:
(1) I agree with the sentiment about having the number of variables bv_thirdparty.sh need to track be minimal.
(2) I don't think you are obligated to conduct the larger surgery just because you uncovered the problem.  

So, I think a good solution is simply collected consensus on what the ""right thing"" is (I think you got it, but others should speak up), and then submitting a ticket so we don't lose track of it.

Best,
Hank

You must have install(TARGETS) rules for them, no?

> With EXPORT() AND INSTALL(EXPORT), does each target need to be 
> explicitly named?

Each target needs to be named in export(), but usually projects
collect the list of names in a global property and then look it up
and export() once at the end of the configuration.

In install(EXPORT) one does not actually name targets.  Those go in

 install(TARGETS ... DESTINATION ... EXPORT MyProject)

to associate them with a particular logical installation export
name.  Then install(EXPORT) creates and installs a file that
refers to all the targets.

So you just need to update each install(TARGETS) rule for the
targets to be exported to add the extra ""EXPORT ..."" and then
do the install(EXPORT) in one place.

I still have the previously mentioned segfault. I have successfully compiled
_simV2.so so that it is using the system Python; this has made no difference.

The segfault occurs in the same location regardless.

Below:

1) ldd output (showing linking against the system Python now).
2) tail of the sim trace (trace.0.txt)
3) tail of strace
4) output of gdb bt after the segfault occurs

It occurs during the second call to
VisItControlInterface_v2.c::VisItProcessEngineCommand

It occurs between the recvfrom and sendto system calls.

It occurs in SimulationCommand::SetCommand, and there's not much to that one:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Set property methods
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

void
SimulationCommand::SetCommand(const std::string &command_)
{
    command = command_;
    Select(ID_command, (void *)&command);
}


Now what? I'd appreciate some help or I'm going to have to find some other way to
instrument what I'm working on. I'm o.k. with C, but C++ makes my head hurt. :-/

  I think i found a solution for the problem. Normally i used the external surface operator to retrieve the surface of a volume, and after that i use the DeferExpression to do the Gauss curvature, the result is always positive, which is wired because for the configuration i used there should be somewhere the value is negative.
   However, yesterday when i tried using the iso-surface operator to get the surface of the volume, and after that using the DeferExpression to do the Gauss curvature everything becomes accurate. The test cases i used includes a simple sphere and one that have concave surfaces. it is very easy to define and you can test it very easily. The dataset of mine is a bit large and i do not think i can send it to you via email.
   The question is that why it doesn't work when i use the external surface operator? Is this operator doing extracting the surface of a volume? Or there must be some aspects that it differs from the iso-surface operator.

-- Cyrus' Note ---
We should see if we can duplicate this with a simple spherical dataset (globe.silo?)  and create a test case that demonstrates this.

(VisIt hanging on startup)

I just had this happen to me on my mac.  The only thing that had changed was that I had pinned the visit icon to my dock.  After removing from dock and starting visit from the launchpad it works again.  I’m clueless.  Any mac experts out there who can shed some light on this?

--

With Rob's info about pinning to the dock -- I was able to recreate this:

1) Clicked on VisIt on my desktop (launchpad will also suffice)

The main VisIt app appears briefly, then the GUI pops up (the GUI is what remains in the dock)

2) Pin the ""VisIt GUI"" to the dock. 

3) Close VisIt

4) Try to open via the pinned icon on the dock, the GUI hangs. 


The problem is that when you pin to this dock this way, it is only the GUI component that is getting launched. The other parts of the puzzle aren't coordinated and the GUI hangs trying to connect to a non existent viewer. If you add VisIt to the dock by dragging the VisIt app over, then things work. 

Not sure if there is a good way to resolve the pinning issue -- we would have to trick OSX into launching the correct script.

Users try to record a setup using a data binning, they are doomed.

If you use ""-nowin"", the data binning operator isn't automatically added (as when you add a data binning based plot, or when a windowed viewer is used)


My recommendation: create new tests in the test suite that actually use the data binning operator.



Here is code that could be s starting point:

 OpenDatabase(""/Users/harrison37/Desktop/visit_tutorial/tutorial_data/rect3d.silo"")

 AddPlot(""Curve"", ""operators/DataBinning/1D/quadmesh3d"")
 AddOperator(""DataBinning"")

 DataBinningAtts.dim1SpecifyRange = 0
 DataBinningAtts.dim1NumBins = 50

 DataBinningAtts.outOfBoundsBehavior = DataBinningAtts.Clamp  # Clamp, Discard

 DataBinningAtts.removeEmptyValFromCurve = 1

 SetOperatorOptions(DataBinningAtts)
 DrawPlots()

 SaveWindow()


I get the error:
 viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: The minimum for the range of a variablemust be less than the maximum


This case is also due to win vs nowin (with win knowing more about the extents of the y var?)

Hello,

It would be great if VisIt could output transparent images with alpha channel. Please consider supporting transparent output in PNG format instead of adding  support to all formats like tiff, etc.

While the python difference workaround could be useful sometimes. It is not really possible to incur the cost of rendering twice just for the sake of generating a transparent image. This is especially true with raycasting or anything with larger dataset, which have expensive render times to begin with.

I have been talking with Britton Chang @ LLNL who has been having issues with using client server from his windows laptop. Things seem to work  fine on his windows desktop with the RZ same account.


On his laptop - it works sometimes, when it works is not network dependent (He has tried on wireless, ethernet, and in different buildings at LLNL)


It fails at different stages in the process, for example:

*hangs before asking for password
*hangs after vcl is launched, but before mdserver is launched
*hangs just before mdserver allows browsing
*hangs just after job submission 


I believe each of these cases represents a point were we make a ssh connection, or setup a component to port forward via our ssh connection. 

I did notice that in one case he had several zombie visit.exe and gui.exe instances. We killed them all but that didn’t resolve the issues. 


It seems that some aspect of the SSH tunnel is being thown off can causing a hang, or it could be we are running out of ports. 

I was hoping someone could tell me magic to enable qtssh debugging on windows so maybe we can probe further. 

If it is related to running out of ports, we should return this error message to the user instead of hanging.

Trying to get in-situ visualization working on OS X 10.11 using OpenMPI. I have succeeded in the past, but now I'm failing for some reason.

Next I run ""recmake_visit.sh"", ""make"" and ""make install"" (I have also tried setting it up manually with ""make package"", but it made no difference).

The mandelbrot example works, and running my simulation on a single process also works. As I run more than one process, the simulation crashes as soon as it reaches the point in the main loop where it detects that VisIt has connected:

Caught signal number 10 BUS: Bus Error, possibly illegal memory access

Does anyone have a clue as to what I'm doing wrong? Has there been any breaking changes in libsim (for example the new batch feature) requiring me to update my code? For example this stub I used to keep just so that the simulation wouldn't crash: http://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1928

viewer: You have non-positive data values, so a log plot won't work.  You must use the limits option to restrict the data limits to values greater than 0.

I imagine there might be other VisIt features that depend on a log scale that break when faced with non-positive data.  Usually when I run across such data sets, I use instead of log(x)

  arcsinh(x / 2) = log((x + sqrt(4 + x^2)) / 2)

which asymptotically and rather quickly approaches log(x) for large x.  This also does the ""right thing"" for negative values by compressing the range symmetrically to how positive values are handled, i.e. arcsinh(x / 2) = -arcsinh(-x / 2).  Maybe this would be a useful feature in VisIt?

Hi Peter,

Thats a clever way to attack the problem.  I think now, users could define this with our expression language.

Better yet, if there was a way to name this expression we could create an easy way to either define the expression or add a named plotting option. 

Any idea of what to call it?

Here are a few suggestions, some of which I've seen elsewhere:

IHS (inverse hyperbolic sine)
asinh (area sinus hyperbolicus)
pseudo logarithm (or pseudolog)

-------------
Hi Everyone, 

This adds an example that clearly demonstrates a case where DDF and Data Binning output do not agree, but should.

( This example uses a contrived mass sum on rect3d.silo )

The issue seems to be related to Data Binning not getting the correct extents when coords are used as binning dimensions. 

I believe this represents the problems that Jonathan Mackey & Phillp Gast have reported on the users list. 

This also demonstrates that the DDF and Data Binning do agree when we explicitly create and use our own input exprs for the coords instead of using the Data Binning options related to the coords.

It is an important reproducer — but the test will fail, so I am adding it to the skip list. 

I also fixed a few issues in the testing infrastructure related with logging assert base test cases.

Hi Praveen,

I wonder if old settings (likely qt-4 based) are undermining things. 

Can you try running “visit –noconfig” and see if it does a better job?

from the path to the app bundle you can run:

VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/visit -noconfig
