I couldn't verify this since none of our test data sets appear to have per material values for variables (or at least none that I could find). The first step is to modify the curv2d.silo generator to put out material specific values for the density that are markedly different so that we can test this. Then we should get this working.

Hello all,

I receive the following error message when I try to add any plot from 
an ensight (.case) file:
""viewer: An invalid variable (Velocity) was specified"".

This file is written by starccm code.  So far, I haven't had any 
problem with such files in my previous simulations. But, the current 
file might be somehow different which causes the error. The only 
difference that I know is that there are several parts (here 
interfaces between regions) in the file which do not have any data 
(e.g., velocity) associated with.

So I wondered if anyone has any solution to this issue. I would be 
happy to sent you the file in case it is required.

Regards,
Mohsen

He also gave me a file, which reproduces the problem. Note that the mesh displays properly. It is just variables that don't display.

Hi Eric,

I’ve noticed what may be a bug in the latest version of Visit.  When you click on the pick option to get values at specific nodal coordinates, in the window that pops up there is an option to increase the maximum number of tabs (default is 8).  However, when I try to increase this number past 8, the number of tabs visible does not increase.  For example, if I set it to 15, I still only see 8 tabs (see below screenshot).  However, I can select 15 different points before the tabs start being overwritten.  In the previous version of Visit 15 tabs would appear at the top so I could see the values of all my picks.

Is there a way to open an older version of Visit on the LC?  I was looking through /usr/gapps/visit/, but there doesn’t seem to be an equivalent “frontendlauncher” executable for the old versions as is present for the current version.  Please advise.

Thank you,
Rishi

Subject: [visit-users] Small bug in VisIt's eigenvector calculation 
 
Hey,
We found a small bug (or inconsistency) in VisIt expression’s eignvector calculation.  The following is what we saw and two screenshots are included in the attached word document.  It’s easy to get around by manually reconstruct the vectors but it would be nice if this inconsistency can be fixed in the future.
 
Figure 1 shows the tensor plot of a stress tensor at an element and the corresponding label plot.  We define an expression eigenvector = eigenvector(StressTensor) and show the value through a label plot in Figure 2.  It looks like the three eigenvectors are the three columns. However, the online help for “Built-in expressions” says
eigenvector(expr)
expr must evaluate to a 3x3 tensor. The eigenvector expression returns the eigenvectors of the 3x3 matrix argument as a tensor (3x3 matrix) valued expression where each row in the tensor is one of the eigenvectors. Use the component index operator ('[]') to access individual eigenvectors.
Example: evecs = eigenvector(tensor), evecs[1]
 
Best wishes

When I have Pseudocolor plot colored by scalar and then choose ""Sphere Geometry"" it appears that scalar values are not transferred and color is not displayed - only lit colorless spheres.

Would imagine it's a quick fix for one who is a VisIt reader expert.

I just updated to VisIt 2.11.0 on OS X 10.12.1. When trying to open an ExodusII file, I get the spinning beach ball and wind up needing to do a force quit. I've tried a few different files, generated both by CUBIT and exported from libMesh. I've verified that I can open the same files using VisIt 2.10.3. I also can open other types of files (e.g. from SAMRAI) in VisIt 2.11.0. I'm currently using the OS X executable from the LLNL site. I'm going to try building VisIt from source to see if that helps.

Hi everyone,

I just want to mention, that 2.10.0 does not build static VisIts (at least not on BlueGene/Q)
(https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/2423)

The reason is the switch from HDF5 1.8.7 to 1.8.14.
HDF5 now requires dlopen(and friends) to compile.
You have to link any HDF5 application now with an additional ""-ldl"".

Example:
 SILO compiles if I change the lines beginning with 28865 in ""configure"" of SILO to
         LIBS=""-lhdf5 -lsz -ldl $LIBS""
      else
         LIBS=""-lhdf5 -ldl $LIBS""

On the HDF5 forum you can read:
 ""We introduced dynamical loading of the HDF5 filters in HDF5 1.8.11 and this library is required now.""

Hi Mark,
I see what you mean, but that's not what I was thinking it would be like. My assumption is that it would maintain the limits during a session. I expected the limit would be reset at the end of the session and start from fresh for the next session. Mostly what I want is for the view to be maintained during a session. I don't care what happens after the session ends. Preserving that is what the save session feature is for.
-Kevin

Well, I checked 2.9.2 and current trunk and it would appear the behavior your describing also exists in those versions.

So, on to next question. Is this intentional?

I suspect it may be. I think if 'maintain view limits' is always enabled the question becomes what does that mean *across* VisIt startups?

Does it mean the view limits that were last in effect when VisIt was exited should be the same limits used when it is restarted? What happens if upon the next startup, the database being viewed is wholly different with different view extents, etc. 

I am not sure if this is a workable behavior in practice.

Can you maybe elaborate on why you would like 'maintain view limits' to always be on?

Mark

Hi VisIt Team,
I prefer the “Maintain View Limits” option to be checked on the advanced tab on the View Controls menu.  Unfortunately, pushing save options seems to not work in the case of this option.  Is this intentional?

Hi Eric,

The feature I'm requesting is to modify the XRay Query to write out the pathlength field separately from the emission field.  This will enable multi-group backlights to be imposed after the Query is run, so that users can study different backlighting strategies when designing experiments.  

For now, users can re-run the Query and supply different multigroup background intensities which is a decent work around.  

The detail of the feature request is as follows (based on the code in VisIt 2.9.1, avtXRayFilter::IntegrateLines(), 

Each zone has:
a : absoprtivity
e : emissivity

and we compute tmp[i] = exp( - a[i] * seqLength)   (for energy bin 'i')
tmp is the 'path length' through the zone (typically denoted by 'tau').   VisIt by default integrates intensities and accumulates them, for bin 'i':

radBins[i] *= tmp[i]    // attenuate incoming radiation by pathlength through current zone
radBins[i] += (1-tmp[i]) * e[i]/a[i]    // add in self emission of current zone

Instead, I propose we add a pathlengh array (per bin, just like radBins), and keep the total pathlength as well:
pathLength[i] += tmp[i]
radBins[i] = <same as before>

Then write both radBins and pathLength as separate binary outputs.  Perhaps this could be turned on only in raw-floats mode if you like."

Hello,

Are there still known issues with the Exodus reader in versions 2.7.x and later?  I saw discussion earlier this summer about an updated Exodus reader plugin, but I am still seeing issues, and some of my collaborators at ARL are also having issues:

1 – Parallel Exodus files are not being loaded correctly in version 2.7.x and 2.8.  For some reason these newer versions of VisIt seem to be stacking the processor files serially, so that only the first of a set of parallelized files are actually being read in and plotted.  (v2.6.2 is still OK)

2 – Automatic file format recognition doesn’t work for parallel Exodus files – has never worked.  User must select Exodus manually.

3 – The Boundary and Filled Boundary plot types don’t work for some reason.  Perhaps materials or material volume fractions are not being recognized?  This also has never worked.

4 – Materials are not being recognized for turning on and off of subsets in a figure.  (May be related to 3 above.)

Hi all,

I would like to make a vector-plot of a nodal field defined on quadratic cells.

I have the components of the field in my database. But after defining an expression for the vector-field, I get the warning shown below - and no vector plot is generated.

--- warning ---

The compute engine ... issued the following warning: The data set has a quadratic element in it and this code to convert 2D elements to polydata is only capable of 1:1 cell to cell translation, whereas quadratic cells produce a 1:N translation. Please contact a VisIt developer to resolve this issue. ...

--- end of warning ---

Attached is an example exodusii-file containing 4 quadratic shell elements and one linear beam element. After reading in the expression ""U"", the vector plot is only showing the vector field defined on the nodes of the linear beam element - but not the vector field on the nodes of the quadratic shell elements.

Any ideas to resolve the issue?

It only created 8 of the 3500 spheres so geometry was not an issue, but it the SZ was about 28Gb and the RSS was about 8Gb. It turns out each region creates a vtkDataSet that gets cached multiple times even if the data sets contain no zones.

He gave me the file and I found an inconsistency between the coordinate array size and the variable size. It turns out this can happen and he gave me a description of what to do in this situation. The e-mail is below:

Hi Eric and John,

Thank you very much for spending so much time on this, and sorry for these strange legacy conventions. One of the many things on the to do list is to make this more sane. 

This mismatch can happen because BOUT++ adds guard cells in y for imposing boundary conditions. If a user collects all the data including guard cells (which is the default) then the output array will be larger than the input grid. The number of extra points will vary depending on the number of guard cells needed, which depends on the numerical schemes used. The number of extra points in y should always be even though: the same number added to each end.

I recommend checking if the y dimensions are consistent. If not, check that the solution file dimensions are larger than the grid file dimensions, and that the number of extra points is even. If not even then raise an error; if even then remove the same number of points from each side of the solution array.

Ixseps1 and ixseps2 determine the locations in x of the branch cuts, and are the number of grid points inside each of the two possible cuts. They can be set to zero or a negative number to mean that all points are outside the cut (and so non periodic), or a large number (which might be bigger than the number of grid points) to mean that all points are inside the cut (and so periodic). 
Zperiod should have a lower bound of 1, but an upper bound is tricky. Once it gets to around 50 you might want to print a warning, as it's unlikely to be physical. Not impossible though.

Thanks again

1713,Rejected,VisIt,Bug,Normal,Client/server from Windows to RZ through VPN doesn't work.,Eric Brugger,"",2.7.2,Eric Brugger,01/27/2014,"",0,"",01/27/2014 04:45 pm,03/11/2014 07:27 pm,3 - Occasional,3 - Major Irritation,2.7.0,"","",All,Any,"Steve Langer reported that an offsite user is unable to get client server working to the RZ through VPN. Here is the text of Steve's e-mail.

Eric:

This is a follow-up to the problems Mike Purvis was having in using Visit to visualize HYDRA runs on the RZ from his office in San Diego. Mike is now dragging HYDRA dump sets from rzmerl to cab (using rzslic). Visit works fine in client-server mode to the CZ, so he is up and running.

In the longer term, I would like to find a way for the client-server mode to work when someone accesses the RZ through an LLNL VPN. LLNL's VPN is currently set up so that all network traffic goes through the VPN. It used to be that only traffic for llnl.gov addresses was routed through the VPN. This change might have had a significant impact on client-server mode. 

It has been several years since I worked with Brad on the port usage of the client-server mode. If I remember correctly, you launch the data engine by ssh'ing a command to the machine where the data engine is supposed to run. That command tells the data engine the ""name"" and port on which the visit client is listening for a connection. I don't remember how it gets the ""name"" of the desktop computer. The proper name to use isn't completely obvious because the hostname changes when the VPN is fired up. 

If visit uses the ""VPN name"", the network traffic will come back through the VPN and the connection should be made OK. If visit uses the original hostname, the traffic should try and go directly to the laptop. The LLNL firewall allows outbound traffic on the visit port, but the laptop no longer responds to its pre-VPN name and the connection should fail. As near as I can tell from Mike's description, client-server mode fails for him when the data engine tries to connect back to the client. 

Have you guys tested client-server mode through the VPN since the VPN was changed to route everything? If not, could you check what name is used when the engine tries to connect back to the server? I think it needs to be something like vpnXXXX.llnl.gov

Thanks,
Steve"

hello there

on our Crays at CSCS, we use SLURM, on top of Cray's own scheduler aprun.
I have found that the internallauncher passes the wrong -N option to aprun (this is different than srun)

as per the man page of aprun, -N indicates the number of processing elts per node.
     [-N | --pes-per-node pes_per_node ]

I therefore patched our internallauncher to the following; Otherwise the jobs don't run because resources are not enabled.

I'd appreciate if this patch (against v 2.7.1) would be included in the next version of VisIt.

I have given you a file on rzalastor that demonstrates this.  If you plot any attribute under the ""Particles"" directory, you will see what I mean

Hi,

Recently, I have visualized a model in VisIt. I wanted to create a 3D image out of it for a website. 
VisIt does not have an opportunity to export x3d files directly. So I had to export a vtk file, open it in Paraview and export as x3d. 
Meanwhile, several visualization tools, such as Paraview, MeshLab, Blender, provide an x3d export. Is it planned to add this feature to VisIt as well?

Hi,

Just a comment comment, and a question:

Comment: it is really confusing for a user if two installations of visit have a plugin for xdmf, but one of them opens the file fine (contains a temporal collection), while the other does not. Now, with some research I found out why (the xdmf library was not built into one, and because of that the (previous) visit xdmf reader was used). I would suggest to make the distinction between the two a little more clear, to avoid users stumbling over this.

Question: Are the build-commands (in particular for svn_bin/build_visit) for the released versions available some place? This could have saved me quite many recompiles.

thanks, Frank

Similar things are happening with XML2. I found the Xdmf references XML2 from VTK. Uintah also depends on XML2, but doesn't try to use the VTK version and will cause the build

Subject: [visit-users] VisIt VTK 7.1 Upgrade -> VTK 8.0

Dear VisIt-Developers,

I'm not sure who is working on the VTK 7.1 Upgrade recently. I just wanted to mention the VTK 7.1 branch builds fine against VTK 8.0 (at least under OSX) except the ""mesh plot"". 
The API of vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper changed, the attached patch for the vtkOpenGLMeshPlotMapperHelper adapts to that change.

I did some digging on this. Using the same Qt tarball that VisIt downloads, but with a slightly modified configure and build environment, I got it working. It no longer complains about missing fonts, nor does it try to draw negative point size fonts.

I don’t have a solid fix yet, but in case someone else tested it, this is what I did:

I took the configure command that bv_qt.sh uses and flipped the “--nomake examples” and “--nomake tests” flags to their respective “--make” flags. The theory here was that it would build its own examples that use text in the GUI and I could see where problems were occurring. I also did the build out-of-source, making a build directory inside qt-everywhere-src-5.10.1/ and running ../configure from within it. I did this external to my working VisIt build, so I also had to manually set the directory in my config-site cmake file.

Ok, unfort. few of us have access to Ubuntu systems to debug this.

I think Trunk version of VisIt is using newer Qt too, right? 5.6.1 vs 5.10.1

Will have to wait until the developer here who does have access to ubuntu will have time to take a look.

Hi Alok,
 
What kind of system are you seeing this on?
 
On OSX, we are seeing *some* funkiness with Qt and VisIt's GUI...but it is still visible and useable -- just cosmetically not behaving as we'd expect/want.

Hello,
 
I have rev 33153 of the trunk. Third-party libs and VisIt build successfully (Ubuntu 16.04), but I get Qt font errors at runtime:
 
QFontDatabase: Cannot find font directory /home/ahota/visit/third_party/visit/qt/5.10.1/linux-x86_64_gcc-5.4/lib/fonts.
Note that Qt no longer ships fonts.

The GUI has no visible text on it anywhere. Opening a menu results in the following error printed for each menu item:
 
QFont::setPointSizeF: Point size <= 0 (-0.750000), must be greater than 0
 
Creating a fonts directory resolves the first two error messages, but not the negative point size, which I assume is affecting all GUI text. Is this happening for anyone else?

Subject: Re: [visit-users] Good resolution in tiled windows

I had some success using commands from your script and googling ffmpeg options, thanks again for sending. Posting what I found here in case it would be helpful to others.  

To remove compression artifacts which are present in video (but not in stills) set 
-c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 
This makes frames indistinguishable to my eye from the still frames. Setting ""-crf 18"" determines the compression level, turn down towards 1 for less compression and larger files. Turn up and compression becomes obvious. The option ""veryslow"" instructs it that time to encode the movie is not important; there are faster algorithms which the internet says are for live telecasts that need to render instantly. 

So far, the best I have found is to output jpeg format at very high resolution (4x HD, fixed 7680 width) then scale down by 4 to HD resolution (1920 width). This looks more crisp than outputting jpeg files at 1920. To tell ffmpeg the scale add 
-vf scale=iw*.25:ih*.25

The final line is then
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i frames%4d.jpeg -vf scale=iw*.25:ih*.25 -r 30 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 frames.mp4

This seems to handle changes in input frame rate well; 30 or 60 fps in output also works well. 

Best, 
Alex

I've been using mp4 but am flexible. I set the width to 1920 and height locked to window ratio, which comes out to 1920x640. The stills are png and have the same resolution, but look much better. 

If I am make a still, usually use a jpeg and set the width to 4096 which (I think) looks even better, and is clearly better zoomed in. 

Are the parameters and lines in that python script those that are passed to ffmpeg by default? Appreciate you sending it, it's helpful.

So, this suggests we need to have the cron job, file system area, etc. that manages nightly testing that runs as a user 'visit' that we all can access.

Hi,

I am running VisIt 2.7.3 on a 64-bit Linux server with the kernel release 2.6.18, compiled using
> build_visit2_7_3 --console --thirdparty-path 3rdparty/ --parallel --python --ccmio --cfitsio --cgns --gdal --hdf5 --netcdf --cmake --icet --no-mesa --qt --silo --szip --vtk --makeflags '-j 6'
Maybe I should add that it is not a client-server install, only a regular compilation on the server to which I ssx -X and where I run the script with
> visit -nowin -cli -s script.py
I attach a stripped down version of the script (using a single file instead of extracting a new silo file at each loop iteration and not setting any plot options) which still went down from 20 pngs/min to 3/min output speed in 2 hours before I stopped it.

I hope this helps, let me know if you need more info. Is this a similar type of case than J.L. Simon's original post?

Best regards,
Yann

Unless the geometry produced by the plots gets wildly more complex over time, it sounds like your combination of plots and operators is resulting in a memory leak. The only user workaround for that is to periodically close the compute engine and start it up again via scripting. However, that should not be necessary as the leak should not exist.

To fix problems like this, it would be helpful to know the version/platform of VisIt being used and for you to share a version of your script that reproduces the problem.

Hello again,

once more I am availing myself of the lists’s excellent know-how to solve the following problem: I am running pretty complex pythons scripts in Visit to visualize large data sets. The sets contain about 300 data files (NetCDF) each and  process about 5 runs in parallel. This means, that I have bash scripts that start 5 instances of Visit from the command line, each with a script.

I observe, that the processing time per data set is a function resembling a 1-exp(x) function. At first the processing goes reasonably fast (5-10 seconds), but very soon the performance starts to sag. In end end, it takes about 30 mins to 1 hour to process one file. I am taking care to close all databases I open and I’m reasonably sure the python code does not produce any memory leaks.

Perhaps I am going on about the problem in the wrong way. Any ideas on how to improve my predicament?

Kind Regards,

Hi Mark,
I see what you mean, but that's not what I was thinking it would be like. My assumption is that it would maintain the limits during a session. I expected the limit would be reset at the end of the session and start from fresh for the next session. Mostly what I want is for the view to be maintained during a session. I don't care what happens after the session ends. Preserving that is what the save session feature is for.
-Kevin

Well, I checked 2.9.2 and current trunk and it would appear the behavior your describing also exists in those versions.

So, on to next question. Is this intentional?

I suspect it may be. I think if 'maintain view limits' is always enabled the question becomes what does that mean *across* VisIt startups?

Does it mean the view limits that were last in effect when VisIt was exited should be the same limits used when it is restarted? What happens if upon the next startup, the database being viewed is wholly different with different view extents, etc. 

I am not sure if this is a workable behavior in practice.

Can you maybe elaborate on why you would like 'maintain view limits' to always be on?

Mark

Hi VisIt Team,
I prefer the “Maintain View Limits” option to be checked on the advanced tab on the View Controls menu.  Unfortunately, pushing save options seems to not work in the case of this option.  Is this intentional?

Hi Eric,

It looks like you own the VisIT builds in /usr/gapps/visit on LC machines. Let me know if this should be going somewhere else though. I took a call from a user yesterday who has an older version of VisIT (2.7.3) on his desktop. He was trying to start a compute engine on rzzeus from VisIT on his desktop, but VisIT would hang when he tried to start it. There was an error on the console:

/usr/gapps/visit/2.7.3/linux-x86_64/bin/viewer: error while loading shared libraries: libMagick++.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I can reproduce the behavior by running /usr/gapps/visit/bin/legacylauncher -v 2.7.3 on rzzeus. I asked the user to move to a newer version of VisIT on his desktop, but I thought I'd also check in with you about whether the older versions of VisIT could be relinked against more recent versions of libMagick++.

Thanks,

Hi Eric,

thanks for answering. Both the ideas would be good for me, because what I would like to see is where the streamlines are pointing, and having the arrows only at the end sometimes is confusing, especially if a lot of the streamlines end in the same point or in a small zone.
Does it sound reasonable?
Thanks

Hi Gabriele,
 
That’s not possible in VisIt, the only option is to have them at the end. I can add an enhancement request for what you have described. I notice that in the python example that there appears to be a single arrow in each streamline, roughly in the center of the streamline (some are clearly closer to the beginning, so it isn’t just the center of each line). Is that what you are after, or are you interested in multiple arrows on each streamline, spaced equally along the streamline at some interval?

Is it possible to plot many arrows along the streamlines and not adding them only at the tip of the streamline?

Hi,

I haven't found a way to do that in the version of VisIt that I have (2.10.3):
by default the range of a color scale in a colormap will automatically adapt to the range of values in the data. Alternatively we can set the minimum and/or the maximum for this scale. For some color scales that have a symmetry (e.g., red - white - blue) it would be useful to fix the center of the scale to a given value (e.g., 0) but let the lower/upper bounds vary depending on the data.

 brugger has been given: 167 KB Nov 01 08:47 eric.tar.gz 1 file(s)

The total MC_Density is 1 CORRECT!

The total MC_Density is 24000 WRONG, SHOULD BE 1000
NumZones

The variable sum is off by a factor of 24. Even though it does not make sense to sum up density this way, sometime we have ""energy"" variables where we need to do this type of sum and visit gives us the wrong answer.
Can you please fix this?

Hi,

I just ran into an oddity working with a user when trying to export a database. 

0. Start Visit.

1. Open a remote database

2. Open the CLI

3. In the CLI

ExportDBAtts = ExportDBAttributes()
ExportDBAtts.allTimes = 0
ExportDBAtts.filename = ""dissipation_data""
ExportDBAtts.dirname = """"
ExportDBAtts.variables = (""CCUVelocity/0"", ""CCVVelocity/0"", ""CCWVelocity/0"", ""dissipationRate/0"", ""density/0"", )
ExportDBAtts.writeUsingGroups = 0
ExportDBAtts.groupSize = 48
ExportDBAtts.opts.types = (0)
ExportDBAtts.opts.help = """"
ExportDBAtts.db_type = ""Xmdv""
ExportDBAtts.db_type_fullname = ""Xmdv_1.0""
ExportDatabase(ExportDBAtts)

Error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
visit.VisItException: ""Xmdv"" is not a valid plugin type.  Make sure the Metadata Server is running.




Now there is a metadata server running. However, it is on the remote machine only. The CLI is not seeing that.


If I do the exact same export via the GUI (and implicitly the Viewer) that works. Which it should because the Viewer sees the remote metadata server. And as expected the exported data is on the remote machine.


If I open a file locally so to start the metadata server then the CLI sees that metadata server and the export will work (though all on the remote machine). And as expected the exported data is on the remote machine.

So the question is why is the CLI not seeing the remote database? I am not sure if this issue is new or not. I believe it is new based on talking with my user.

Cheers,

As far, I only found a check box to make it visible or invisible and no option to move its origin.
A dirty workaround involves gimp, which seems a bit unnecessary.

Eric,
 
I am having trouble making a movie in VisIT. Can you help me?
I want to put two different slices of a 3D simulation side by side in a movie.
 
The first time I attempted this, I only got the contents of Window 2 in the movie. Next, I went into File -> Set save options and checked Multi-window save and Tiled. This time I got both plots in each frame, but only the one from Window 2 advanced in time with each frame. The Window-1 plot was the time=0 data in every frame.
 
How do I make this work?"

Here is his e-mail.

Eric,

As far as I have ever known, VisIT has always lacked the ability to save the viewport settings for Curve view and 2D view to persist between sessions. This is very annoying because the default settings always cause overlap between the graphics content and the Legend, Database, and Time annotations. Every time I start up VisIT, I have to manually open Controls -> View and change the Viewport from “0.2 0.95 0.15 0.95” to “0.25 0.95 0.1 0.9.” There is no Make default button as there is for every other Control. If I set the Viewport as I want it and then do Options -> Save Settings, then the new settings do get written to ~/.visit/config; however, when I start up VisIT again, the viewport settings are still “0.2 0.95 0.15 0.95.”

Can you please fix this?

I'm doing some testing of volume plots and have found what seems to be a bug.

In the Volume plots dialog, on the 1D transfer function tab, I select color table 'difference'. The blue-white-red color scheme is then shown with three markers - one at the left end (blue), one in the middle (white), and one at the right end (red). Then I go to the commands dialog, clear the code box and start recording. I go back to the 1D transfer function settings and press Apply. Then I stop recording. Among the recorded code I see

VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(0).colors = (0, 0, 255, 255)
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(0).position = 0
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(1).colors = (255, 255, 255, 255)
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(1).position = 0.5
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(2).colors = (255, 0, 0, 255)
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(2).position = 1
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.smoothing = VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.Linear

Now I press the Execute button in the Commands dialog. Suddenly a yellow marker appears between the white and the red color in the color scheme.   

I’m using VisIt 2.10.0 but have also confirmed this behaviour in 2.12.3."

The attached code was generated in VisIt 2.12.3 by doing the following:

•	Add a contour plot (Add > Contour > Pressure)
•	Apply contour plot attributes without modification (double click Contour, click Apply in Contour plot attributes dialog)
•	Stop recording (click Stop in Commands dialog)

When I then try to run the code using

the execution ends with the following message:

Hi Andy,

Does the animation play at a fairly rapid rate (many frames per second) or slowly (a second or more per frame)?

The stop button in Visit 2.13.0 often doesn’t work. If an animation plays for a while then I can’t get it to stop no matter how many times I click the stop button or how long I wait.
