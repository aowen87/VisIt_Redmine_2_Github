The SAMRAI folks are beginning work on their own MIR algorithms whichthey will be using within their code. They'll need to debug it andwould like to visualize the MIR as they computed it, not as VisItwould.
There are multiple approache here. Some involve exchange of code thatcomputes the MIR. Another approach is to allow for the pre-computedMIR to be stored to the database. This might be possible withoutmodifying Silo. Here is the basic idea.
The original mesh is simply a zoo of elements (for QuadMesh's its azoo of size 1). The pre-computed MIR has the effect of NOT changingany elements that are clean and introducing a tiny zoo of elements onany elements that are mixing. In theory, a data-producer could make aUCD mesh (or several of them) consiting of the union of all the newelements introduced by MIR. It would be a funny mesh in that it wouldbe approx 1 original-mesh-zone thick and wind around the 3D volumefollowing the MIR boundaries. But it would nonetheless be an objectSilo currently supports. The only additional bit of information thatmight be useful is to define a UCDVar on the MIR mesh that identifiedthe original-mesh-zone id from which the newly introduced zones comefrom.
Given this information in the file, VisIt would then offer an optionof either computing its own MIR or using the one thats there.

I have inadvertently given visit bad command-line arguments on many occasions. However, it neither reports this to me nor fails to start because of them. Maybe I want to collect some debug logs and pass '-debg 5'. Only after I have run visit do I realize I've spelled it wrong.
Visit should check all command-line arguments and fail to start of it doesn't recognize any.

Al Nichols was using the new movie template code in VisIt and he created a 2x2 viewport layout but only mapped sequences to viewports 0,1,2 and not to 3. The movie script chugged through generating images for the first 3 viewports and died on the 4th since it had no sequences. It probably died in the compositing phase of the script.
The movie script should be fixed so it can handle viewports with no sequences.

A user spent a lot of time (several hours) getting a series of queries over time into a VisIt window. He had several curves there generated throughout the morning.
Then, he accidentally tried to add a PC plot of a mesh variable to the window with the curves in it. That operation threw an exception (plot dimensions don't match or something like that) and then promptly invalidated all his time curves. They were gone for good.
First, we probably should not be invalidating existing plots because a new plot was not valid. Second, what can we do to protect users against this loss of information, particular long operations such as queries over time?
This user has since taken to exporting dbs after he generates his time curves.

From Jeremy Meredith:

When generating an attribute subject from an XML file, it looks thereare a couple problems with the code generated for fields when usingaccess settings other than ""private"".  I believe you can expose this bymaking an XML file with a single float field, setting its access toeither ""protected"" or ""public"", and trying to compile.
For ""protected"", I would still expect the Set/Get methods to getgenerated, because there's no other way for external clients of theclass to set/get their valuyes.  (In fact, should protected be thedefault instead of private?  I tend to use protected members more oftenthan private in general.)
As for ""public"", I'm not sure how to Select() the field for notificationwithout using Set/Get, but I suppose that's up to the client.  (That'sthe downside of public members to begin with, so maybe that's not aconcern.)
But whether or not the Set/Get functions are generated, it looks likethe SetFromNode function is still calling the Set method, which leads toa compilation error.  (CreateNode does not seem to use the Get method,however.)  At the very least, for public members (and maybe protected ifwe decide they shouldn't have Get/Set functions) members, SetFromNodeshouldn't use the Set function.

24,Pending,Bug,Normal, need intrinsice/extrinsic flag for re-centering operations ,-,-,-,Cyrus Harrison,,,0%,,06/21/2010 07:14 pm,,4 - Common,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,< 1.12,,,All,DOE/ASC,"
cq-id: VisIt00008584cq-submitter: Mark Millercq-submit-date: 04/15/08
I listed this as a bug but one could argue that it is really an enhancement request.
The user reported that after re-center a mass quantity from its native zone-centered state to a node-centered state, mass was created. As we spoke, it made perfect sense to me given what recentering in VisIt is doing. When we re-center in VisIt from zones to nodes, we...
a) visit each node   b) find all zones that share the node   c) add up the zonal values for those zones   d) divide (average) by the number of zones
However, the user explained that for the mass quantity he wasdealing with, the right algorithm is...
a) visit each zone   b) divide the zonal value by the number of nodes the zone has   c) accumulate the value to each of the zone's nodes
This is fundamentally the difference between an intrinsic and extrinsic quantity. An intrinsic quantity is one that DOES NOT change as you cut a zone into smaller pieces. Temperature is an example. If you cut a zone of temperature T0 into two pieces, each piece will have temperature T0. However, if you cut a zone of mass M1 into pieces, each piece will have a mass different from M1 (usually related to volume differences assuming a constant density)
VisIt needs to know the 'intrinsic'/'extrinsic' nature of its variables. That is a new flag on all avtXXXMetaData objects which can have the values; Extrinsic, Intrinsic, Unspecified. In the case that a variable's intrinsic-ness is Unspecified, the user needs the ability to specify which recentering algorithm above to use. So, re-center in PC plot and recenter expression need an option for this.
A separate ticket is for Silo to include extrnisic/intrinsic options in its variables.

Changing the 'number format' for a contour plot's legend hasno effect on the tick-mark labels, only on min/max.
I noticed this while working on some changes to the legends.I don't know if users would even want to change this ... butI thought I'd document the problem.
Current implementation details:
Our vtk class for legends has the ability for tick mark labelsfor 'levels' type legends to be supplied as strings or doubles.
Currently, no plot sends the values as double.  I would expectContour plot to be using the double-path, since its labels are the isovalues used in generating the plot.
However, the isovalues are generated by avtContourFilter, andthose double values are converted to strings using a hard-codednumber format. The strings are then sent as 'labels' attachedto the vtkDataSets in the pipeline. Contour plot retrievesthose string labels and sends them to the levels legend.
When the legend's number format is changed, the tick marklabels are not affected, obviously, because they are strings,not doubles.

VisIt contains logic to remove what it thinks are 'internal' edges from a mesh plot when it renders them.  It uses avtOriginalZoneNumbers to drive this logic. I think the logic is...
...given an edge, if all the zones that share that edge have the same 'avtOriginalZoneNumber', the edge is removed. However, this fails on edges that are in fact external to the whole plot as it removes them when it should not. So, if an edge is external to the whole plot, keep it regardless, otherwise, remove as per current algorithm.
You can see this behavior when plotting arb. polyhedral data from silo.

This ticket is a big deal for Gunther and I.  But I don't have the guts to make the change without consulting the experts.  It appears to be a problem with 1.7.1 and with 1.9.0b.
Here is a reproducer with the current version of the code.  (We are making some changes that exacerbate this problem.)
1) Open /trunk/data/Chombo_plot_data/plot00000.2d.hdf52) Make a PC plot of U_vel3) Bring up the subset window and turn off some levels4) Draw5) Delete the plot6) Make a new PC plot of U_vel7) Bring up the Subset window.  All of the levels are on.  This is not correct.  It should be the same as the SIL restriction from the first plot.
However, if you reverse steps 3 and 4, when you look at the subset window in step 7, some of the levels will be off (correctly).
Here's what I think is going wrong:In step 4, the call to ViewerPlotList::UpdatePlots() enacts a call to clear the default SIL restrictions.  It only clears the default SIL restrictions for time varying data.  The default SIL restrictions live as a data member named ""SILRestrictions"" in the ViewerPlotList.
When you reverse steps 3 and 4, it means that the Draw causes the clear to happen before you set the SIL restriction.  Since you set the SIL restriction afterwards, it will become the new default and then everything will work correctly.
I'm happy to make the change here, but I feel a little gunshy, since this code is so central and there is a chance for unforeseen side effects.
Also, note that the bug is actually worse than what I'm describing above.  If you make a plot, draw, change the levels, apply the SIL change, delete the plot, and make a new plot, then everythings work fine (the new SIL is preserved).  But, if you then delete this new plot and another one, it goes back to turning all of the levels on.(You have to do a SetSILRestriction after each DrawPlots to make it work correctly.)

I only investigated the plot using vel_rad asthe x-coordinate.
The gist is that the scatter plot is colored red whenrestored from the sessionfile, but when created freshhas lots of green, cyan and blue color.
All variables being used for the scatter plot are expressions, and the min/max for the Color variablehave been changed from default.
data is is /usr/gapps/visit/bug_data/visit_bug_8570.tar.gz on OCF.

From Marcel's email:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Hello,

I found a strange bug in Visit that has to do with scatter plot. If you open the attached session file then the colour of the points is not correct. If one then:
- goes to scatter plots attributes- disables the min/max values for the color range- apply button- enables the min/max values for the color range again- apply button
=> colours are correct => but min/max values are still 0
Added ESB 4/4/2008:

From additional e-mails:

Addition: If the plot is in a state where it shows the correct colour with a black background and then tries to swap the background/foreground colours => all points are black (with white background) and I found no way so far to change that....
Ok - a further addition: if I change the sphape into spheres instead of points, change to white background, start the keyframe animation then the colours come back after a few frames and I can even switch now between different background colours and the colours of the points are correct. So there is some wired stuff going on here... but I hope this probably helps to hunt down the bug...

We know about this issue and there could be another ticket for it but here is a new instance of the problem.
Chad Noble gave me a Silo file that takes forever to open. I timed VisIt and the Silo file itself takes 17-30 seconds to open. That's way slow and there are a lot of subdirectories, etc that make the file reading slow.
The real problem is that once the file is open, each plot menu takes about 30 seconds to construct due to the large number of variables. Essentially, we're waiting about 20(menus)*30(sec/menu) seconds. I gave up each time since it was too long to wait to open a file.
We need to rethink our menus. Where possible, we need to share like menus between plots. We also should consider a way of dynamically creating different levels of the menu on the fly so they get created as we scroll to them. These enhancements, if possible, should greatly speed up menu creation and make file opening more tolerable for these types of files. If menu changes are not possible, we might switch the plot menus to an alternate, more efficient widget above a certain number of variables.
It's worth noting that the existing code (albeit somewhat modified) is 10x faster on my Qt4 branch. That's a large improvement but we should also implement other speed improvements.

Hank Shay has some data where the simulation says there are inverted tets. To find out where things are going wrong he  tried to use the volume expression & look for negative volumes - but it appears VisIt is being too smart here and fixing the inverted tets somewhere in the pipeline.  For debugging he wants a version of the volume expression that can identify this case.

To demonstrate the problem, edit visitdiff.py in SyncTimeStates method and comment out the calls to GetMetaData with 'currentTimeState' arg.

Hank Shay was trying to limit the extent of a query over time and ran into several problems.He was looking at silo files and the time slider displayed cycle numbers so it had not readthe times from all the files. So here are his problems.
1) He tried to limit it by time and specified a time less than between 0 and 1 and theGUI just set it to 0 after he hit Apply. I assume the GUI is code so as to only takeintegers. It should take them for times.
2) He tried to limit it by cycle and set it to a reasonable cycle and then it said that itwas out of range. When he did the query it did the entire range.
I also played with query over time with wave and set the cycle range to be 10 to 50, whichworked, but the cycles displayed on the x axis went from 100 to 500. I don't know why thiswas off by a factor of 10.

When we do lineouts of zone-centered quantities, it is possible to obtain to plots that contain other than perfectly flat (slope=0) or perfectly vertical (slope=inf) line segments. However, this seems inaccurate because the field being sampled is piecewise constant. A lineout of such a field should, in theory, never have any line segment with 0 < slope < inf.
Perhaps the problem is really when we go to display the lineout 'samples' we obtain. Because we always wind up drawing line segments between the points effectively linearly interpolating the 'samples.'
Wouldn't it be more accurate to, for zone-centered quantities, compute the intersections of the line with each zone (which will yield line segments) and then assign the zone's value to that segment?
MCM -- Added 28Jan08--------------------

From an email from Kathleen...

We don't really 'march' along the ray -- we use an interval tree(created using spatial extents of zones) to determine which zones 'might' be intersected by the ray, (in the case of non rectilinear data, we then perform more intersection tests on the candidate zones)
Thus we have a list of zones that have been intersected by theray, along with their intersection points (used in calculating distancealong the ray).  The 'intersection point' is the point (usually alonga face) where the ray 'entered' the zone.
A 1D rectilinear grid is then constructed, with the x-values beingthe distance along the ray of each intersection point.  The zone-centeredvalue of that intersected zone then becomes the scalar assigned tothe corresponding x-value in the grid.  if the variable is node-centered,then the value assigned to the grid is an average of all thenode-values for that zone (the entire zone, not the 'entry' face).
MCM -- Added 28Jan08.
I've committed a test data file and am attaching some curveplots from doing lineouts on it. The input data is like so..

The 'zonal_var' is a stair case from 0.5 in zone 0to 4.5 in zone 5. The 'nodal_var' is a ramp from 0at nodes 0 & 6 to 5 at nodes 5 and 11.
All lineouts are from (0, 0.5, 0) to (5, 0.5, 0) using theLineout Query.
Curve 0: is a lineout of the zonal_varCurve 1: is a lineout of the nodal_varCurve 2: is a lineout of zonal_var with sampling on and 500 samplesCurve 3: is a lineout of nodal_var with sampling on and 500 samples
Note that curve 0 and curve 1 both fall right on top of each other.They also both start at a value of 0.5. For nodal, this is off by0.5. It should start at 0. For zonal, its ok. So, curve 1 is too high by 0.5 over its whole length but is otherwise ok.Also (and I know we're not set up to do this right now), I'd arguethat curve 0 should be a stair case, not a ramp. But, that isanother issue with how VisIt is drawing lineout results.
Now, the sampling results, curves 2 and 3, are more interesting.I would expect the sampling result for the zonal_var to be prettyclose to a stair case. But is is still coming out a ramp. This seemsreally off as most samples should be falling within just a singlezone and then getting evaluated to whatever that zone's zonal_varvalue is. I would expect roughly 100 samples in zone 0 at a valueof 0.5, follwed by 100 samples in zone 1 at a value of 1.5, etc.
The sample results for the nodal_var look good. Note that bothsampling results are 0.5 below the non-sampled results.

This was the original problem repoted by Jose.

Jose Milovich was running client server and he wanted to export a database in VTK format.
He couldn't find the file after he saved it. It turned out when you select the directory
to store the file, it shows you the file system on the local machine and not the
remote machine (not surprisingly). He choose a directory that existed on the local
machine, but not on the remote machine so the file did not get saved. We should
either show the directory system on the remote machine or make it clear that it will
end up on the remote machine and not let the user browse the file system to select
the directory. Jose also thought that the default should be the same directory where
the data was located, not the users home directory on the remote machine.

It turns out fixing this in general can be quite difficult involving reasoning backwards from the plot to be exported, which engine the plot is associated with, then the host that engine is running on, then bringing up a file browser remotely connected to that filesystem, etc.
But, something simple we can do is to prevent attempts to browse the filesystem when in client/server mode by graying out (disabling) the browse button. This will prevent users from being lulled into incorrectly thinking they are browsing the remote (engine) filesystem.

A user has 10,000 materials and hundreds of domains. Currently, Silo plugin requires that all Multimat and DBmaterial objects define all materials numbers (and, optionally, names and colors). This is wasteful when the actual domains contain only a few materials. The Silo plugin should be able to operate from knowledge of ALL the material info from the Multimat object alone.

This is just not true and the expression works as it should in VisIt 1.11.0. Maybe VisIt 2.0z is choking on this file because it has multiple meshes.

Basically, we will wind up attempt to 'cache' everything from the current timestep as well as anything that Database infrastructure (plugin classes themselves or avt/Database classes) decided to cache at timestep '-1' (which means forever). Things associated with the current timestep get removed from the cache when the timestep is changed or someone explicitly tells the database to clear caches (like user hitting the button in the gui).

I fixed a problem with how DBForceSingle() was being handled inthe Silo plugin. It was being called with argument of 1, turnedON that is, ONLY when the state variable, dontForceSingle was0. That means if you ever initially opened with default settings(e.g. dontForceSingle was zero), then if you changed it laterto be OFF (e.g. dontForceSingle was non-zero), then it wouldjust NOT call DBForceSingle. Now, it calls DBForceSingle() alwaysand sets arg to !dontForceSingle. This is 'better' but revealsa broader problem though. The force single state of Silo is asetting that is global to the whole library. If two databasesare opened one with the setting the one way and one with thesetting the other, then the resultant behavior for BOTH databaseswill be whichever the setting was for the LAST opened database.
What we need to do is have each Silo-based plugin (Vista, SAMI,Silo) maintain a local copy of Silo's global state and re-enumeratethat to Silo just prior to doing any operations to read data inorder to get completely correct behavior.

To make sure mesh plot lines (as well as other entities) don't wind up sometimes falling behind polygons, we offset them towards the eyepoint just a bit. Well, if you plot globe.silo mesh and rotate around, you can definately generate cases where mesh lines disappear and/or oscillate visibility.
I am certain this is NOT related to Mesa 7.5 as I can re-produce in 1.11.2.
We need to revisit this logic again. Maybe globe.silo is just a bad case where most quads are non-planar
MCM -- Added 31Aug09--------------------I looked at the 'face_planarity' metric for globe.silo to see if there are a lot of hexahedra there with non-planar faces. There are NOT.  And, just from the way the sphere geometry is sampled, I actually do NOT think it is possible for there to be non-planar quads.
So, the problem with mesh lines dissappearing is NOT due to non-planar faces.

When we read in and then later export a mesh with material data on it, the exported material data has been 'remapped' by VisIt such that it does NOT match what was input to VisIt. The reason this happens is that internally, VisIt remaps the array representing the (lets just focus on non-mixed -- clean -- case for simplicity) array representing the material id in each zone to a 0...Nmats-1 values. I think all that is necessary is to include in avtMaterialMetaData and then also in avtMaterial the mapping from VisIt's internal material numbers (0...Nmats-1) to the original numbers. A simple intVector should suffice. That way, a writer can re-map if it so chooses. Of course, it'd be better if the remapping was done in the writer base classes so that each individual writer doesn't need to deal with it.
MCM -- Added 31Aug09--------------------In Silo and NASTRAN, where materials are exported, there is logic for sort of two cases; one when material selection is ON. In that case, the mesh that gets exported is not necessarily the same as the mesh that gets input. This is definitely true for mixing materials. The other case is just to write out the avtMaterial object that exists internally in VisIt, regardless of selection.

Plot 1 is a field and uses the default settings for Isosurface and Pseudocolor.Plot 2 is a field that is rendered as 25% opaque, and otherwise uses default settings.
I can add these plots and draw them once without any issue.  However, if I then hit the ""draw"" button and then rotate the view, plot 2 disappears.  Happens every single time.
Steps to duplicate:1. Run VisIt2. Open crabcavpython3p_YeeMagField_1.h53. Add a pseudocolor plot of YeeMagField_04. Add a pseudocolor plot of YeeMagField_15. Add the isosurface operator (this step may not be necessary to reproduce the bug, but otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the problem)6. Double-click on Pseudocolor for the YeeMagField_1 plot.7. Set ""Opaque"" to 25%8. Hit Apply & Dismiss9. Hit draw10. Hit draw again11. Rotate the view - plot 2 will disappear.

We have a re-open operation. Why? I think this is to handle the case where the contents of the file VisIt currently has open changes out from underneath VisIt. On Windows, this can never happen (well, almost never, read on) so why have the button there at all on Windows? On windows, you have to close the database before its contents can be changed. This may have to do with how VisIt opens files on windows. Since we are using the sec2/stdio interfaces (C library) for accessing files on windows, I think we get default behavior for file sharing semantics there and, you can't ever change a files contents while VisIt has it open on windows. If you attempt it, you get an error saying the file is in use by another application.

Perhaps the most important thing cloning a window does is to ensure it has all the same plots and operators. That works fine. And, I check a number of other attributes of windows such as scalable rendering mode, stereo mode, even lights. They all seem to track fine across cloning of windows; at least from window 0 to window 1. I did NOT testing cloning when say 3 or 4 windows are already up with different attributes settings.
At any rate, we do NOT track window size and aspect ratio across clones and at least one user has indicated that we should. I agree.
I rated seriousness as a 'major irritation' because I can imagine what a pain it is if you go to some trouble to get a window that is just the right size and aspect and then need to clone one or more (several times) that don't obey that same setting.

Karnig Mikaelian wanted to revolve a 2d plot into 3d. His mesh was a 2d curvilinear mesh that had asingle block with ghost zones all around it. When he revolved the plot he got the no datamessage. This can be replicated with curv2d.silo. I think the problem is that because thereare ghost zones all around all the geometry is removed by the facelist filter.
I got around this by doing threshold operator to the 2d data and saving that out as a vtkfile, reading that back in and then doing the revolve.
There should be a better way. Either make visit smarter or add an operator that allows theghost zones to be stripped before doing the revolve.

Hello, I'd like to report a problem I've been running into with memory use when visualizing large point data.  The problem occurs when looking at a molecule plot with a clip operator (I'm pretty sure it happens with other types of plots too, but this is what I've looked at the most).  Every time the clip plane is modified, each engine_par process grabs about 100MB of memory.
I have recreated the problem using the galaxy example data (much smaller), to make sure it isn't a problem with our data reader plugin.  To get a decent sized data set, I modified galaxy.C to set NPOINTS to 150000 (any more than that seems to make the galaxy executable segfault).  I then open galaxy0000.silo, and create two molecule plots (again to increase dataset size), and a clipping plane operator.  Then, every time I change the clipping plane, each engine_par process grabs another 5-10MB.  This isn't so bad since the data size is still relatively small, but it's easy to run out of memory this way with large datasets.
I have tried both svn trunk from several months ago, and the 2.0 rc branch as of this morning, and they both have the same problem.

Not sure if many people know this but VisIt can handle SR mode from multiple engines.
However, when it does and you do save windows, it winds up getting annotations wrong. Annotations from plots on one engine wind up getting drawn on top of annotations from plots on another engine.
Annotations were handled 'strangely' when SR mode was first introduced. So, they sometimes get handled on the engine and sometimes on the viewer. When saving a window in non-screen-capture mode, the engine handles annotations. When handling an SR render to update the viewer's window, the engine does NOT handle annotations.
For the multi-engine case, only the viewer has enough knowledge to handle them correctly I think. No single engine does, right? I mean if there are two PC plots, one each from engine A and B, the fact that one plot's legend must appear 'lower' in the viewer window than the other is not known by either engine.
But during a save window, the engine is supposed to render everything including the annotations. So, this is a problematic case.

We rated large task cost here because we assumed that is why the issues outlined here are/were not addressed when these new functions were introduced...
1) While visit-experts might understand when and why to use a 'cell_constant' or 'point_constant' expression, ordinariy users most likely will not. I am pretty sure they would neither think to look for these expressions or, even after stumbling into them, would really know when/why to use them. This is a pitch for saying that these expressions should happen 'automatically' whenever a user uses a constant in an expression and should NOT require the user to do something special to get constant behavior.
2) The names 'cell' and 'point' probably mean a lot more to a visit-developer than to a user who is most likely going to think 'zone' and 'node' which is also the same terminology the rest of VisIt's GUI uses. So, it probably makes sense to rename these.
3) We also need constants for vectors, maybe colors and tensors too.

The SAMRAI folks are beginning work on their own MIR algorithms which they will be using within their code. They'll need to debug it and would like to visualize the MIR as they computed it, not as VisIt would.
There are multiple approache here. Some involve exchange of code that computes the MIR. Another approach is to allow for the pre-computed MIR to be stored to the database. This might be possible without modifying Silo. Here is the basic idea.
The original mesh is simply a zoo of elements (for QuadMesh's its a zoo of size 1). The pre-computed MIR has the effect of NOT changing any elements that are clean and introducing a tiny zoo of elements on any elements that are mixing. In theory, a data-producer could make a UCD mesh (or several of them) consiting of the union of all the new elements introduced by MIR. It would be a funny mesh in that it would be approx 1 original-mesh-zone thick and wind around the 3D volume following the MIR boundaries. But it would nonetheless be an object Silo currently supports. The only additional bit of information that might be useful is to define a UCDVar on the MIR mesh that identified the original-mesh-zone id from which the newly introduced zones come from.
Given this information in the file, VisIt would then offer an option of either computing its own MIR or using the one thats there.

visit -diff was designed with a basic assmption that two databases have identical structure. This need not be the case and when it is not, visit -diff is useless.
However, this can be easily fixed by adding some conditional code within visit -diff (using the Python callable method) to call user-defined .py code in a separate file passed to visit -diff which does following...
a) Given a variable name in the 'left' database generates the   equivalent variable name in the 'right' database (or null   indicating none exists).b) Defines additional expressions on the right database.
This could be achieved pretty easily by defining two symbols...
MapVarName="""" RightExpressions=""""

Why is the option of plotting 'points' on a curve plot an either/or option? It looks like curve plot can be plotted using 'lines' or using 'points.' I'd like to make a plot using lines but with little triangle symbols at every 10th point. I don't think this is possible with current interface. I think the two options are orthogonal and should be independently controlled. One option is whether to connect the 'space' between points with lines.

MCM -- Added 28Sep09--------------------Ok, I checked and as I interpret this user's request, I do NOT think it is a dup. I think this user wants to ensure that it is possible to a) draw the curve with only points (as 8930 suggests) and b) use only the points that the input database contains (e.g. don't add any filler points). And, I think this is a very useful thing for curve plot to ensure.

Also, what does symbol 'density' mean? it looks like its an 'int' valued field that can be only greater than zero. Does a value of K there mean to plot every Kth point? Also, while the GUI would allow me to manually type in a larger number, I could not also decrease the value by typing manually. I can use only the inc/dec arrows to actaully decrease this value. So, when I typed 1000 in to see what happened, I then had to set there and hold the dec arrow down for 5 minutes to get it to decriment back down to a 'normal' value.
-------Added CDH 7/14/09-------The range for this spin box is 10 <-> 1000.The previous (pre Qt4) behavior was if you typed in a number below 10, you would end up with 10. Now you just get last successful number. So I believe Mark  was trying to type a number less than 10 to lower the value from 1000 and thought the spin box was broken.
The meaning of ""density"" isn't very obvious and the arbitrary minimum of 10 is the source of the confusion.Should we set the minimum to 1?

The e-mail from Justin (luitjens@cs.utah.edu):
Hi,
I have a suggestion for how to improve the bounding box navigationfeature.  Currently the bounding box appears only at the bounds ofyour data.  It would be nice if there was a second navigation boxthat was scaled within your viewer.  A problem with the currentbounding box system exists when you are zoomed in on your datato the point that you can no longer see the bounds of the domain.At this point bounding box navigation is no longer useful as youcannot see the bounding box and cannot know how far you have translated,rotated, or zoomed in.  If there were a second box thatwas scaled according to the viewer this navigation method wouldstill be useful.  My idea is that reguardless of your rotation, zoomlevel, or translation the box would always start at the same placein the viewer and then as you do you motions it would move.  Ifyou finished a motion and then did another motion the box wouldstart back in the default position (relative to the viewer). If this already exists could you please tell me how to do this?
Thanks,Justin
Added by ESB:This could be done by putting a box in the view with the same aspectratios as the data extents with a view that only consists of the orientationportions of the tranform matrix and then manipulating that. If the userpans, zooms or rotates, then apply those deltas to the real matrix.

cq-id: VisIt00008927cq-submitter: Mark Millercq-submit-date: 05/13/09
With large, large point meshes, it can be the case that many points in the mesh map to same pixel in image. I believe our current rendering technique results in a 'last writer wins' for color of whole pixel. This yields poor results if the point mesh is such that most of the points at the 'end' of the series of points in the mesh have some unique property such as a variable that is defined there is substantially lower than all other points.
A solution here is to at least 'randomize' the order in which points are rendered from the point mesh such that any properties (variables) on the points are also randomized relative to their render order.
Another solution might be to use point cloud rendering code (GPL licensed), here...

I belive we have discussed this issue before, but a quick search of clearquest left me empty handed. Here is the issue as reported by Matt O'Brien.
=========We save particle position and direction in 3D Cartesian space, but we run lots of 2D cylindrical (r,z) problems.
So we plot the mesh and materials in 2D, and apply the ""Project"" operator to plot fields defined on the particles.
But the ""Project"" operator gives the wrong picture when we plot the velocity vectors.   A straight line vector in 3D does not become a straight line vector under a 2D (r,z) cylindrical projection.It is a curved hyperbola.  But visit is showing a straight line in 2D.
Is it possible to enhance visit to correctly plot a 2D cylindrical projection of a vector?

I know in the Unix world, this is the standard procedure.  However, on a Mac, this is a very foreign concept to many users.  I know of no other application that needs to start this way.  Chapter 3 of of Getting Started PDF shows how to start on Unix and Windows, please add a subsection on how to start on a Mac with very detailed instructions on where the Terminal application is located, how to change directories, and how to launch VisIT.
2) I work with a program that supports Byte (1byte), INT (2 bytes) and Long INT (4 bytes).  The Getting Data Into visit PDF has a good section on brick of values (BOV) files.  For the example header in section 3.1 please add a comment how many bytes each of the 4 data types expects.

It would be nice to be able to use the scatter plot to do a 'phase plot'. Suppose we have time varying voltage and current measured  from a circuit. A phase plot of voltage vs. current might look like an ellipse.
However, scatter plot is enabled ONLY when there are multiple variables ON THE SAME MESH. Scatter plot plots variables ONLY from the same mesh.
Since curves in VisIt don't really have a 'mesh' that they live on (each curve defines its own mesh), we can't ever scatter plot curve variables. We ought to be able to though.

This is related to 8959.
Our scatter plot does not generate actual paths in 'phase space' even if the input data is 'phase related'. All you get is a bunch of points. I think when the numbers of points are low as in curve data (see 8959), we ought to have the option of 'drawing lines between points known to be neighbors in the input mesh'. I think this option would be useful even for 2 and 3D rect and unstructured grids of moderate size. Yes, you would get what appears to be inter-tangled lines, but the trend the lines would suggest might be more useful than just the dots themselves.

=========================

From Preeti's email:

I am using the NETCDF output files from WRF(Weather Research andForecast Model). The basic reader is not being used for this. Thebasic NETCDF reader could not display all variables properly so I hadcoded a NETCDF reader for WRF. It can recognize all variables and timedimension as well.
I have seen the code for the same in BasicNETCDFFileFormat.C in VisItv1.11.1 and v1.12.0. I have tried to read the WRF output NETCDF fileusing this basic reader, it recognizes the file but the domaindecomposition does not occur. I would like to elaborate my findingsregarding this,
In databases/NETCDF/avtBasicNETCDFFileFormat.C,line #272 -- PopulateDatabaseMetaData -- This function has a call toReturnValidDimensions like below
Line 411                    bool valid = ReturnValidDimensions(meshDims,                         validDims, nValidDims);
Since this is called using 3 arguments, the rest two are 0 (asdeclared in header file)As a result in function 'ReturnValidDimensions' in Line #518, the ifstatement ""if (!(dimStarts && dimCounts))"" is always true, thus thefunction returns without proceeding to the domain decomposition codeie the function 'ComputeRectilinearDecomposition' at Line #562 isnever called, Hence no domain decomposition occurs.
I have verified this from the log files also.Please let me know if I made some mistake in understanding.

The e-mail chain for the request:
John,    The short answer is there is no way to install different private plugins for more than one version of VisIt. We've run into this problem in the past as well. I think adding this capability would be fairly easy. It might even be as simple as including a version number into the $visitprivateplugins variable's path inside the internallauncher script. That is where the VISITPLUGINDIR environment variable that VisIt uses to obtain its plugin directories gets set up.
Brad

Multiple versions of visit can be installed with svn_bin/visit-install, 
which puts them in a directory structure that looks like 
VISITDIR/VERSION_A/PLATFORM_1 (referring to 
<http://**www.**visitusers.org/index.php?title=InstallingVisItUnix>).
This makes it easy to maintain a public plugin for different versions 
since they happily live along side of each other.  However, it looks 
like the directory structure in ~/.visit doesn't match, with only 
subdirectories for the platform, but not the version.  Is there an easy 
way to have a private plugin for different visit versions?

Closing a database used to be buried down in 1-2 levels of cascading menus and so was not used very often, if at all. Now, its right at the top. But, I often have problems closing a database. VisIt tells me it can't close a database with plots still up. So, then I have to hunt through the list of plots to find those from the database I want to close and delete them.
A user requested that it would be nice if hitting the close button presented the user with three options...   a) delete all plots and close WITHOUT saving a session   b) delete all plots and close AND save a session   c) cancelOr, perhaps the interface would just put up a dialog saying, ""in order to close this database, VisIt is about to delete all plots associated with THIS database. Would you like to save a sesssion first?""
[Updated by Cyrus Harrison]
I think we should warn them that closing the database will delete all plots using the database & prompt them to continue - not sure we need to add an option to save the save session into the mix. If they want to save the session they can 'cancel' the close & save the session before closing the database.
[Updated by Mark Miller]
If we're going to add an extra step at all (e.g. as in Cyrus' suggestion a warn-and-continue dialog), I am not sure I see any value in NOT providing a 'save session' option there on the same dialog. I mean, at the very least you would want some text there saying something like 'Hey, you have plots from this database in the plot list. Closing the database means they are all going to be deleted. If you want to be able to re-create them later, consider saving the session' and once you've gone that far, having a button there to actual do the save isn't a big leap.
[Updated by Mark Miller]
Maybe it makes sense to offer the 'save session' option ONLY in the case that ALL the plots would wind up being deleted. In that case, that is essentially the whole session.
[Updated by Cyrus Harrison]
Adding the option to save the session is there to help them recover if they accidentally delete plots correct? Why isn't warning them that this is about to happen sufficient? Maybe we can list the plots that are about to be axed to thoroughly communicate to the user what is about to happen.
It seems clearer to just say: Closing 'zzzz' database will result in deleting plots (1,2,3,...) - are you sure you want to do this?
Instead of: Do you really want to delete plots used by this database & do you want to save an session just in case you don't understand that you are about to delete plots used by this database?

[Updated by Mark Miller]
Ok, here is my own experience. I have plots up. I want to close a database for one reason or another. I never remember that I have to delete all its plots first. I just try to close it. I get a message saying 'you have to delete plots first'. I hunt through the plot list deleting all the (relevant) plots. I then close the database. I am sure almost any (novice) user will have the same experience, multiple times in fact. I think that behavior is problematic. What would be better?
Just quietly delete all the plots and close the database. Well, thats not necessarily a good thing if a person did NOT want to delete those plots and did NOT releaize that closing a database would have that effect. So, just quietly deleting them is probably bad. So, just warn them with an option to 'continue' or 'cancel'. I think thats Cyrus' suggestion.
Well, why is the person closing the database? If the attempt to close is solely to close and NOT part of some larger close and open again later scenario, then 'continue' and 'cancel' I think are sufficient. However, if the attempt to close is part of some larger sequence of operations to close now, open again later and see the same plots again (note, this is apparently a common situation on windows where re-open is totally useless see #41), then having the additional option to 'save session' is useful. Perhaps it is most useful when the ONLY plots that are in the plot list are from the same database though.
[Updated by Cyrus Harrison]
It sounds like there is an orthogonal issue with windows we need to solve. I am not sure if it is easily solvable, but I don't think we should conflate closing a database (and deleting its plots) with the more specific use case of closing a database as means to reopen it & recreate the existing plots as work around for a specific platform.

Multi-level AMR problems allow you to do a subset plot of 'levels', however if a dataset evolves to have a single level (for example if the grid is completely refined & all lower levels are dropped) this breaks the subset plot.
A similar thing happens if you are plotting ""domains"" and you drop down to have a single domain.

Ed Kokko would like a way to group his variables in his .mili file.Hi use-case is to declutter the variable windows and make variables easier to find.
Couple of suggestions:1)  Allow user to modify .mili file, prepending group names to variables, eg   group1/var1   group1/var2   group2/subgroup1/var3
Then have VisIt's Mili reader parse these 'grouped' variables correctly whenaccessing the database.
2)  Modify makemili to allow user to specify variable 'aliases' that can beparsed correctly in the Reader.
I think #1 might be easy to implement, only if the Mili files don't alreadysupport variables with ""/"".

When we export to Silo, we get one file per MPI task in VisIt. It would be nice to be able to allow the user to choose the number of files produced much like Ale3d currently writes its restart/plot dumps. Silo libs' pmpio macros may be useful in this.
If we don't provide this option to 'collect' domains in common files, we may want to at least provide a means to 'throttle' number of MPI tasks writing files at any one time so that we ensure we don't overwhelm filesystem and wind up with much poorer performance for large numbers of MPI tasks writing files. This throttling could be handled in VisIt proper

I am not sure we support units for expressions in VisIt. However, Silo's DBPutDefvars call allows callers to define units for the expressions. A user has requested these be visible in VisIt just as units on ordinary variables are.
This may or may not be a lot of work. We don't support units through expressions right now. We probably ought to. But, all that is needed to satisfy this is to ensure that whatever units the Silo file said should be associated with the RESULT of an expression should just be bound to them. So, it doesn't really require that expressions support units, just bind any units specified by the database upon completing the expression.

Here is the e-mail from the reporter (jain@mcs.anl.gov).
Hi,
Thanks. Actually, I had some problems with the MOAB/FMDB that ships with VisIt. It was due to stricter checking of header files by gcc-4.4.3. Particularly for MOAB: I had to add header  #include <stdio.h> to the following files:
/ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/WriteHDF5.cpp/ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/tools/convert.cpp - /ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/tools/skin.cpp/ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/tools/iMesh/
It looked like FMDB has similar problems.

I spoke with Mark about this and he will patch the later versions of the libraries withfixes to resolve this problem. build_visit will be updated to use the new libraries.

When you go to create a movie with the movie wizard, one of the options is to have it give you the command to create the movie so that you can run it later. When it does that it saves a session file and gives you the command to run. One of the things that it saves in the session file is the launch parameters for launching the engine the same way you were when you went to save the movie. For example, if you were running in parallel with 4 processors it should run with 4 processors when you later create the movie. Instead it just runs a serial engine.
To reproduce this problem I did the following:
1) Open wave.silo.2) When the engine launching window comes up, run with 4 processors.3) Create a pseudocolor plot of pressure.4) Bring up the movie wizard, have it create a movie of png images.5) In the very last window, have it give you the command to run to save the movie and save the command.6) Exit VisIt.7) Execute the command given in step 5.
You will see that it starts a serial engine.
Here is the output I got, which clearly shows I ran it in parallel and then when I created the movie it ran a serial engine.

A common use case in a time series is for a variable to either NOT be defined for early timesteps but BE defined for later timesteps or to have NO DATA for early timesteps and HAVE DATA for later timesteps. We don't handle this situation well in VisIt. If the user happens to open a database at a timestep in which the variable is NOT defined, it won't appear in the menus at all. If they open the database at a timestep where the variable is defined, plot it and then move to a timestep where it is not defined, they get invalid variable exceptions and a red plot that will only ever get back to green if they manually re-draw it for a suitable timestep.
If the database returns NULL for a GetMesh/GetVar call, that generally triggers an error. We could define some vtkDataset and vtkDataArray valued constants that a plugin may return to indicate 'variable not available for this timestep' such that VisIt would know that the variable is defined but there is no deta for the current timestep. Additionally, we could add metadata to a variable indicating whether or not it might return these constant valued indicators for some timesteps -- though I do NOT think that is really necessary.
This way, VisIt could distinguish between a real error, NULL return, and a case where the database rightly expected to have no data for the given timestep.

191,Resolved,Bug,Urgent, VisIt restarts a died engine with a serial engine when run in nowin mode. ,Jeremy Meredith,-,2.0.2,Eric Brugger,06/30/2010,,0%,,06/30/2010 12:30 pm,07/13/2010 04:31 pm,4 - Common,5 - Very Serious,2.0.0,,,All,Any,"
When you run visit under the cli to produce a movie in ""nowin"" mode, it used to be that if the engine died (either with a crash or running out of time in a batch system), visit would restart the engine using the same parameters as it was running before it crashed (e.g. if it was running in parallel with N cpus in the batch system, it would start a new engine in the batch system with N cpus). In 2.0 it starts a serial engine.
This is a very serious problem for those making movies in a batch system.
Here is command that reproduces it, along with the script used.
visit -v 2.0 -cli -nowin -s visit_script.py

I use resample often and always find that I always need to go in and manually reset its parameters to be appropriate to the dataset I'm using. For example if I'm working with 2D data, resample comes up with 3D box checked, and I have to uncheck that. Also, it does not get the range of the independent variables right. It generally seems to clip things off at the edges and I have to go in and put the min/max values in manually. Finally, the resolution (I think the default is 10)  for the resampling is always to coarse for the data I'm working with. One usually wants a resolution that's finer than the dataset one is using.Could the defaults for resample be made a little more intelligent so that better guesses are made based on the properties of the data stream going into it? This would save the user from having to go in and tweak things each time.

In the save image/set save options menu item, it would be helpful if Visit would provide the option of removing surrounding whitespace from the saved image. i.e., if one is saving an image whose aspect ratio is different from Visit's standard square viewing window, then I tend to usually have crop it later to get rid of the un-needed whitespace.

In addition, it supports an option to use a single integer value to identify the block-type for all blocks when they are all the same type.

The Silo plugin in VisIt should be enhanced to support this as it will soon become an important feature to our codes.

VisIt makes it possible to interactively explore through data along spatial dimensions (using the interactive controls with the various slicing operators).  It is also possible to explore through the time dimension using the animation controls.  However, interactively exploring through other dimensions is difficult.
In my case, I have mesh data with scalar variables set upon mesh elements.  I want to be able to explore this data by displaying only those elements for which a scalar variable T takes on values in [n,m].  I can do this by using the Threshold operator, but this operator requires me to type in values for n and m, and retype the values if I want to change them.  It's a cumbersome process if I want to vary the threshold quickly.
The process could be improved by allowing the lower and upper bound settings of the threshold operator to be controlled by sliders.  Note that a special case exists when the user wants to see data taking on exactly one discrete value (i.e. when n=m).  In this case, it may be desirable to have a single interactive slider to control the value of the threshold.

When running the VisIt 2.0.1 binary installed on Mac OS X 10.5.8, I create a plot.  I want to select a variable to plot.  I click Add > Pseudocolor, and I see a long list of variables - longer than the size of the menu - so the list is truncated nad has a down-facing arrow at the bottom.  I try to scroll using either the scroll function on my mouse, or by hovering the mouse over the down arrow at the bottom of the menu, but neither work.  I am also unable to use the arrow keys, once the menu is open, to highlight an element or move through the list of elements.  I can use the mouse to first highlight a particular element of the list, and then use the arrow keys to move the selection down to the end of the list, but I cannot use the arrow keys without first highlighting a list element with the mouse.
I see the same behavior and problems with all long lists - if I click the Variable button to change the variable being plotted, or if I try to create other types of plots, I see the same issue with those menus as well.
The expected behavior of large menus is as follows:1. If I open the large menu, and move the mouse over the down arrow at the bottom of the menu, I expect the menu to scroll down through elements of the list (this functionality worked fine in the Visit 1.11 and 1.12 binaries for the same OS, Mac 10.5.8).2. If I open the large menu, and scroll up or down using the mouse, I expect the menu to scroll up or down through the elements of the list (this functionality also worked fine in Visit 1.11 and 1.12 binaries).3. If I open the large menu, and push the up arrow, I expect the highlighter to highlight the last item in the list and move up through the list as I press the up button.  4. If I open the large menu and push the down arrow, I expect the highlighter to highlight the first item in the list and move down through the list as I press the down button.

299,Expired,Bug,Low, Libs listed in H5Part.xml are not all direct dependencies ,Eric Brugger,-,2.3.2,Mark Miller,07/30/2010,,0%,,07/30/2010 10:32 pm,07/20/2011 09:57 am,2 - Rare,1 - Not Serious,2.0.0,,,All,Any,"
I ran into this fixing Xdmf cmake logic after r12072 revealed it was broken.
This is subtle but I think important.
If a plugin is DIRECTLY dependent on a lib, that dependency is EXPLICITLY handled in the plugin's .xml file. In other words, the plugin source code within VisIt DIRECTLY REQUIRES that library in order to even compile. Now, if through using one of these DIRECTLY REQUIRED libs, some other library dependency is introduced, that is a) unknown the the plugin developer and b) handled by the LIBDEP variable for the library.
Now, it isn't immediately obvious to me whether H5Part is or is NOT directly dependent on the libraries listed in its .xml file. It lists H5Part, HDF5, FastBit and zlib. I don't think its directly dependent on zlib so maybe that needs to be removed. But, it at leasts looks to me like there are libs listed in the .xml file for H5Part that the source code for that plugin is in fact NOT dependent on. If so, those should be handled by defining a LIBDEP variable for H5PART and then listing in that variable all its lib's dependent LIBDEP variables.

When making a change in an Annotation dialog, all the fonts for the active window are changed form their present state to Courier bold & italic. This occurs even for unrelated changes like turning the grid on or adding an additional annotation object. I believe this is because the controls for those values are not initialized to the settings on the current plot when the dialog is opened.
Also, the initial font selections (Courier, bold, italic) are different from the default for new plots (Arial).

when support for specifying the topological dimension of a ucdmesh was added to silo, it was done in such a way that it 'defaulted' to spatial dimension. Thats bad because the Silo library was filling in some important data on behalf of the client by 'guessing'. But downstream tools couldn't possible know it was a 'guess' and treated it as 'fact.'
Later, the silo library was changed so that if the topological dimension was NOT specified, then it would remain that way in the file. However, there is a bug in the drivers that is a hold over from the 'old' way it was being handled such that some of Silo's internal state for topological dimension is 'saved' from call to call and guesses, really bad ones, wound up in the file.

Eric reports that sometimes, itaps test hangs in parallel. but, scalable parallel works alright.
I ran valgrind on the tests and see a slew of memory errors.
The itaps libs were updated recently and perhaps memory errors are causing problems for parllel execution.
Long story short, some cases in itaps.py are skipped in parallel by adding logic to the .py file. This is because just adding tests to skip list does NOT prevent actual execution (only diffing logic) and so skip list cannot be used to avoid the hang.

Running some analysis on an AMR data set it was painfully clear that naive domain assignment was causing a big load balancing problem. Some process contained an order of magnitude more zones than others despite the same domain count. This is common scenario for AMR data. B/c not all algorithms play well with dynamic load balancing -  it would be helpful to create a simpler load balancing mode that takes into consideration the complexity of each domain. For AMR, we can (hopefully) use the hierarchy toautomatically inform complexity & we should allow plugins to publish complexity metadata as well.
PS:Using -lb-random greatly helps in this case - but it would still be nice to implement this.

My guess is that pseudocolor plot is trying to make triangles but there are no triangles to make so it does nothing. It would seem to me that if it can not generate tris then it should try lines. If no lines then points. If no points then an error message saying no geometry.

There's sort of 2 parts to this. The first is a crash:
1. Open wave.visit2. Add a Pseudocolor plot of pressure and draw3. Do a VariableSum query over time4. Pick on the generated curve to see that it works5. Go back to window 1 and change time steps6. Pick on the generated curve again in window 2. The engine will crash!
I was doing these exercises to inspect peaks in my VariableSum vs time curve plots. I'd pick a peak and then I'd go to that time step to see what data caused the peak. It worked one time and then on the 2nd pick, the engine would crash.
When the engine restarts, it can't pick on the data since it doesn't know about the curve results. That's a separate issue but it would be nice if the query was redone automatically.

With trunk version on Linux, a default Streamline plot yields no data, changing to using a plane source yields no data. Changing the plane parameters appears to hang VisIt, but checking the engine logs, the engine SEGV'd.
I haven't tested with any other data formats.

The viewer will crash in the splatting volume renderer (if you're using splatting).With 3D texturing, the view will be bad so no plot. No crash though. There's an exception in the engine if you try using the software VR.
My guess is that spatial extents are not created for the output mesh made by DataBinning.

This used to be an occasional problem, but now is occurring almost every time I open a file using ""-o"" on the command line.
The symptom varies between:(1) the file mostly appears to open, but all plots are still grayed out, so acts like it didn't open(2) I get an error saying ""the file /home/jeremy/PickAttributes doesn't exist"" (or some other state object-related string, maybe a memory error?)(3) visit immediately crashes(4) visit starts to work, and then crashes when you try to do anything with a big glibc memory error trace
And occasionally, it works.  Typically, it will work if I'm starting visit from cold start, i.e. no visit libraries cached.  But if I've just launched visit, then try this (so that the total launch takes only a few seconds), it almost always fails.  This would imply a race condition, but the path of how this delayed-open-launch behavior works is hard to debug since I'm not familiar with it.
Note that I don't see a problem with using the CLI, just the GUI.  This is on linux (where I often use ""-o"").
Also, I believe that ""-sessionfile"" seems to cause problems as well.  This might cause problems with movie making!

Currently, the PATH environment variable appears to be prepended to each time I upgrade VisIt, and the entries from previous installations remain until the corresponding version is uninstalled.
For example, my PATH currently starts with
C:\Program Files\LLNL\VisIt 2.0.2;C:\Program Files\LLNL\VisIt 2.0.1;

I'm not sure what the advantage of having two or more entries is, as earlier matches in the PATH string shadow later ones. The only situation where a match in the 2.0.1 directory would occur would be if an executable was installed there in that version but not any later version. If such a match did occur, the user wouldn't necessarily know which executable was selected. That's a relatively rare occurrence, but if it does happen, it's likely not what the user intended.
It looks like an older version could block a newer one if the older version were installed more recently. I don't know how common that situation is, though.
An option to remove all other VisIt entries from the PATH when installing might prevent potential confusion.

HPC centers often only allow connections to their compute clusters through trusted login machines. Often, this will mean that there is an ssh machine to which outside users connect and from there, they ssh again to the login node of the compute cluster. We've had requests to make it easier to deal with this type of network setup.
I suppose that vcl could run as usual on the ssh machine, tunneling connections back to the viewer on the client's local machine. Then that vcl would launch another vcl on the login node via ssh and that vcl would actually launch the mdserver and engine. Maybe this could be represented by having composite hostnames with a delimiter such as host1,host2,... Such a host name would tell VisIt to first launch vcl on host1 and then from there on host2 and so on. Once vcl is launched where it needs to go and it tunnels connections back through the various layers back to the viewer, it should be possible to just send commands that ultimately end up at the farthest vcl where the components would actually be launched. Of course, I don't know how to handle multiple ssh stages that require different accounts/passwords. That might be common as well.

An external user complained that the Surface plot used the incorrect values to label its Z axis. I told him to try Pseudocolor+Elevate instead. When I tried that myself, it looked okay until I used ""Elevation height relative to XY limits"". It makes sense. That option scales the Z values until the data are roughly cube-shaped. The Surface plot exhibits this more easily since it always seems to use the ""Elevation height relative to XY limits"" feature internally.
I think the solution here is for the rendering to scale the plot into a cube shape while still labeling the axes with their untransformed values -- another reason to have 3D fullframe.
1. Open Noise.silo2. Surface plot of hgsliceThe Z-axis shows bad values that don't match the numbers in the plot legend.

make package doesn't package up the ITAPS shared libraries, so when VisIt is run there are error message at startup about missing shared libraries and of course the ITAPS plugins won't work. This can be fixed by either installing only static libraries or fixing the make package script so that it packages up the shared libraries. I guess either way works. It seems like doing the static libraries would be easier. I ran into this problem both on yana and hoth and I moved the shared libriares into a directory named shared and the problem went away.

Several plot's attributes include min/max settings to set the data range for the variable being displayed. However, this notion is associated more with the variable itself than with the plot. As user's change variables in a plot, they constantly have to re-adjust the min/max values.
One way to 'fix' the current way we do business is for the GUI to cache plot attributes per-variable such that if a plots attributes are adjusted, the variable is changed and then set back, the user will get whatever settings they last set for that variable. That would certainly address the user request (from Al Nichols), that triggered this ticket.
Thinking more broadly though...
We already have variable attributes as per avtXXXMetaData objects. In fact, I believe these even offer the ability to specify the variables 'extents'. Why not create user-adjustable equivalents of 'variable attributes' so that users can 'do things' on a per-variable attributes basis that make sense. Certainly, setting min/max values is one such thing. I don't know but maybe setting things like precision (e.g. float/double), error bars (e.g. uncerttainty), default color map, etc., might be useful as well.

As users move back and forth through time or between different databases sharing the same variable(s), user would like an option to have the data limits for a variable update automatically to whatever the min/max range is over all that have been seen to that point.
I thought we already handled this across time. But, user says it does not happen. At any rate, I am fairly certain we do not maintain it across different databases. It sounds like a different swizzle on the 'min' 'max' entries we current use in various plot attributes (and maybe legends) that means 'max over all that have been seen' instead of 'max of current input/view'

I also noticed that Silo 4.7.2's silex appeared to link against a static Silo library so it did not have any problems. Bottom line: silex doesn't work without setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

I have run into an issue when using a molecule plot on a MD dataset.  I believe it happens when visit decides to use display lists.  If I have a mocule plot with atoms in different domains, sometimes only the atoms of certain domains will show up (maybe just either the first or last domain?).  I've found three ways to work around it:
- tell visit to never use display lists- tell visit to always use scalable rendering- set the molecule plot to use impostors for the atoms

I have a pseudo color plot that is plotting a point cloud of data. If I select the point type to be icosahedron and scale by the default variable. Sometimes I get the correct result. Sometimes I get nothing. When I get the correct result and go to another time step I typically get nothing. If I go back to the time step where the result was correct previously I get nothing. As such, it seems like the scaling feature has some problems. Oddly with another data set it seems to be working okay.

An APDEC/ANAG user encountered a problem with using the ThreeSlice operator together with material interface reconstruction. As soon as he turned of one of the materials, the VisIt engine will crash.
Due to its size, I cannot upload the file. It is available at /project/projectdirs/visit/plot.nx128.step0000375.3d.hdf5.gz on NERSC machines.
Reproducing the problem:- Open dataset- Create Pseudocolor plot of any variable (e.g. ""temperature-fluid"")- Add ThreeSlice operator- Go to material selection, disable mat2- Draw plot-> Engine crashes
Additional information:- At least once, the crash seemed to occur when a GetCell call on a vtkDataSet return 0 as result (even though GetNumberOfCells returned a value different from zero)- Using the ""-dump"" option, I did get data sets with point data but with no ""CELLS"" keyword/information. These data sets seemed to correspond to domains that are comprised entirely of the material that is turned off.-> This leads me to believe that it may be related to optimizations we added for handling domains in a data set that are comprised entirely of a single material.
I found the problem both in 2.0.1 and the current trunk. I also reproduced the problem on Linux (64bit) and MacOS (10.6-64bit).

Suppose I have the following:string const dbname(""output/3d_outplace.silo"");
And somewhere along in the code:DBfile *silodb = DBCreate(dbname.c_str(), DB_NOCLOBBER, DB_LOCAL, NULL, DB_PDB);
Now suppose that the directory 'output' doesn't exist yet. In that case the file can't be created. When using the DB_PDB as above, a 'Segmentation fault' results.However, if I do the same with the HDF5 driver:
DBfile *silodb = DBCreate(dbname.c_str(), DB_NOCLOBBER, DB_LOCAL, NULL, DB_HDF5);
In this scenario a clear errormessage results and the program continuous, allowing to check for NULL on this pointer and deal with it accordingly:DBCreate: File not found or invalid permissions: output/3d_outplace.silo
I'd suspect this is a bug in the standard PDB driver. A simple work-around is to use the HDF5 driver, even though that introduces (maybe unwanted) dependencies into the code.

Some discontinuities were noted with AMR data attributed to poor handling of ghost data. After searching, there is a fundamental problem with VisIt's ghost data generation routines. It assumes that patches align such that AMR patches share complete boundary faces, which is not a valid assumption. This came out recently from a conversation with Jeremy Meredith, who wrote the original version. His comment was ""back to the drawing board"" with respect to the original implementation. Estimate: 6 weeks. Is this our chance to fix general t-junction problem at coarse/fine level boundaries? Estimate: 3 months)

Jean Favre demonstrated a case where a mesh plot and a pseudocolor plot in the same window will only show the pseudocolor.
The issue seems limited to 2D data.  It only happens when he saves a window, and ""Screen capture"" fixes it.  Elevating both plots to 3D with the mesh plot a bit above the pseudocolor plot also seems to fix the problem.  Thus we suspect Z-fighting.
See the attached image -- note the two plots in the legend on the left, yet the mesh is clearly not visible.
He is using the trunk, r12720.

Mike Wickett has a dataset where the available nodelists change as the simulation progresses.  (The dataset is @ /g/g24/cyrush/visit/issue00427 on LLNL OCF)
If you create a mesh plot of ""slide_mesh"" & then reopen on any timestep with a different set of nodelists - the reopen will turn off all sets in the SIL & produce a plot with no data.
It appears some how topset is incorrect for this mesh (the second in the file) due to the change of sets representing the nodelists (which are only defined on the first mesh).
I tested VisIt 1.x and this didn't happen, it started in version 2.0.0.

Perhaps there this is just a developer education issue. However, we have CL args that influence behavior of various components some of which are documented and handled directly in internallauncher, some of which are documented in internallauncher but not really handled there, some of which are not documented in internallauncher but handled elsewhere (see the slew of engine debug arguments) and, then again, a variety of these are also handled via host profiles. Some arguments seem to have had same name and purpose to different components (e.g. -timeout for mdserver and engine) but recent changes have broken one or the other (e.g. -idle-timeout used to specify engine idle timeout so now mdserver will get whatever its default timeout is which may or may not be same as engine's). Some arguments can only be controlled by passing on CL directly. Others are controlled by both CL and host profiles, etc.
This just seems like a mish/mash of methods for handling the following issues...a) documenting the meaning of a CL argument in such a way that users can easily obtain itb) providing nice GUI to set themc) ensuring different components get the right argumentsd) detecting invalid argument combinations and/or option values and issueing useful error messages.
If there is some systematic strategy that is being used here that I am not seeing, please someone explain it to me.Otherwise, this is in need of an overhaul.

The host profiles that we distribute with VisIt should have placeholders where more user information is required.  An example is the bank. Some profiles require that users enter a bank before they can submit jobs. Rather than prompt users for a possible bank at install time, this should be done at run time.  A placeholder of some type should be in the initial host profile for the bank.  At runtime, and the first time a profile with a placeholder is used, VisIt should prompt the user for the value of that field.  This could pertain to any item in the profile, not just bank.  The entered value would then be stored back in the profile, memorized for future use.
This would allow us to no longer prompt for the bank at install time (confusing users), and would allow prompting for other information. It would allow multiple host profiles with placeholders to be installed at once.

VisIt should have the ability to import and export host profiles as separate files.
Ideally, users should be able to open a host profile through the normal File Open dialog.  VisIt should then detect that it's a host profile file an import it appropriately.  (This has the potential to cross a network boundary between the mdserver and the viewer.)

Andy Cook reported to me that he could not launch VisIt on LLNL's prism but it worked yesterday (Oct 19, 2010). When I had him start VisIt in his home directory, he was able to get nodes. I was able to reproduce the failure like this:
1. cd2. mkdir visit_test3. chmod 500 visit_test4. cd visit_test5. visit6. Open a data file and choose a profile that requires msub/srun like prism. The engine appears to start but it quits before connecting to the viewer.

1. Open wave*.silo database2. Make a Pseudocolor plot of pressure3. Draw4. Make expression Y = coords(quadmesh)[1]5.

I think the root cause of this problem is in the Silo library itself; 4.7.2. The RC exhibits the problem but not the trunk. It may require updating the Silo library for VisIt and I am not sure we ordinarily do that for patch releases.
However, attached to this ticket are two Silo files, one with PDB driver and equiv. with HDF5 driver. On Alastor.llnl.gov, VisIt fails to open HDF5 one correctly, even issuing a low-level Silo error that Silo was NOT compiled with HDF5 support. However, velodyne plugin is attempted first. It is an HDF5 plugin and when I disable it, Silo successfully opens the file. I think velodyne might be corrupting internal HDF5 lib state before Silo plugin even sees it. But, I don't honestly know.

When doing a time query on a Silo database, currently no curves are shown until the entire query is complete. It would be useful to show a coarse version of the time curve first, then successively higher resolution versions of the curve as more plot files are read. For example, if my database's time resolution is 2 microseconds, it could show every 100, 20, then every 10, then every 2, filling in more points and updating the display after each sample.

The creation of plane tool geometry causes a crash when VisIt is used in ale3d to plot a mesh of in-situ data.
I commented out all code in the engine to make a vis window, returning immediately from SetWindowAttributes and SetAnnotAtts and I was able to get the mesh to plot. This leads me to believe that either there is an error in the plane tool code or something about loading VisIt into Ale3D causes that code to misbehave and ultimately crash.
Look for memory errors in the plane tool initialization.
Does the engine really need to create the vis window before it ever does an SR? It seems wasteful and causes a crash in this case.

Olivier Cessenat ran into this problem.
Silo library appears to be trying to compress datasets it explicitly should NOT (at leaest it is designed that way). My first glance at the code is that it is NOT honoring the 'flags=0' when setting up compression in db_hdf5_set_compression.
An attached c code demonstrates the problem.

I needed to export data that I indexselect'd down to a small size so I could plot it as a 2D bar graph in Excel. I ended up having to write a script that used pick to extract 25x25 values that I wrote to a text file. It would have been far nicer to use the PlainText plugin to export the data as a text file in spreadsheet form.  Hmm. I guess I could have used the Spreadsheet plot instead... Still, this would be a nice feature.

The Elevate operator currently displaces the nodes in the Z direction and makes an unstructured mesh that contains the surface. This is good but I'd also like an option for cell-centered data to elevate each 2d cell according to its height and then create additional wall quads/tris that bridge the vertical gap down to the adjacent cell (think walls on a skyscraper). I could have used VisIt instead of Excel if we had this feature.

Open bigsil.siloAdd PC plotDraw.Remove a few domains using the Subset selection Window.Apply.Delete the plot.Add Mesh PlotDraw.Notice that the SIL selection you applied previously still holds.Attempt to turn on all sets using the 'All Sets: Turn On' button from the 'Whole' column.Doesn't work.Using the checkbox does.
You can also get into the same state with 1 plot if the 'Turn on' button is alreadyselected, and you turn off a few sets using their checkboxes.  You cannot then use the'Turn On' from the 'Whole' column (though it will work from the category column).
If you turn off a few domains, then separately turn off a few materials, then the 'Turn On' fromthe 'Whole' column doesn't work.
'Reverse' and 'Turn off' seem to work just fine under similar circumstances.

For this report I'm not sure whether I came across something that is designed that way, or whether it is really a bug. Also I don't know how general the behavior is. I have noticed it when trying to pass a DBOPT_DTIME or DBOPT_TIME and DBOPT_CYCLE to a dataset that is written with DBPutQuadvar.Consider for example the test-code wave.c. Suppose we change line 165/166 to:
DBPutQuadvar1(dbfile, ""pressure"", ""quadmesh"", var, dims, ndims, NULL,                  0, DB_FLOAT, DB_NODECENT, NULL);
I would expect that the options DBOPT_DTIME and DBOPT_CYCLE are not part of the output now. But they are. Now suppose we change this line back to the original and remove the 'optList' argument to 'DBPutQuadMesh' instead. Since I'm passing the options to DBPutQuadvar1() I would expect that the option values are part of the output. But they aren't.So it seems that these option values are only exported when passed to the DBPutQuadmesh() function and not to the DBPutQuadvar1() function. I'm not arguing this is wrong (even though I do think such values have more meaning for a dataset than for a mesh) but it definitely is not behavior as documented in the manual (to be honest: these options are documented as valid for both functions; and wouldn't know what to do if they get eg different values, except maybe for storing the value passed last) In the manual these option values are documented as valid for both functions, so I would expect that I can send them to the output using either of them.

Suppose one wants to script a movie, to be ran by 'visit -movie' for creating the required output. Also suppose that I want to separate out pieces of code in order to keep the main script readable.So I create some script, say filtermovie.py, in which I import functions/classes that take care of the animation from another file, say filter_mover.py:in filtermovie.py:from filter_mover import *
This is correct Python and the script will run as well. However, when run under visit movie, the following error results:-<output cut---/data/users/jakobb/linux/64/comp_packs/visit2.1.0/2.1.0/linux-x86_64/bin/makemoviemain.py:3: RuntimeWarning: Parent module 'filtermovie' not found while handling absolute import

The errors suggest that the actual script filtermovie.py can not even be found, but the traceback suggests that the main cause of the problem is that the filter_mover.py module can not be found.
A work-around is to add the current directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable: (for (t)csh):$ setenv PYTHONPATH $PWDor$ setenv PYTHONPATH ""$PWD:$PYTHONPATH"" (first case when PYTHONPATH is not already defined, the second when it is)For bash it will be something similar with the 'export' command.
Even though a work-around is available, this problem should be dealt with by the makemovie script (it could eg explicitly add the directory where visit -movie was started to sys.path)

The visit -movie has tremendous problems in different non-standard and standard situations in dealing with directories; here I report two different versions that fail:
1.Suppose I have written a script that explicitly sets the directory for output when calling SaveWindow():swa = SaveWindowAttributes()swa.outputToCurrentDirectory = Falseswa.outputDirectory = ""some/dir""
Now when this script is ran with 'visit movie', the frames will be written to 'some/dir', yet the makemovie.py script doesn't notice. It just creates a directory [outputname]# (with outputname defaulting to 'movie') and after rendering all frames, it calls ffmpeg with i [outputname]#/mpeg_link%04d.format  (with format the extension corresponding to swa.format - this attribute IS correctly passed on)There are two problems here: - the filename mismatches (I didn't do anything do it, so frames called 'some/dir/visit%04d.format' where created)- it's the wrong directory
Clearly ffmpeg will fail, with:/path/to/script/movie-0/mpeg_link%04d.jpeg: No such file or directory
2.So let's leave everything to default and run the script:- still all output files are created in the current directory, instead of the [outputname]-#/ directoryHence, again: the ffmpeg will fail, which is again directed to files [outputname]-#/mpeg_link%04d.format

This is apparently Kitware's bug:
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=10778&nbn=1
but our users are getting bit by it, so it'd be nice if we could find some kind of workaround.
As a summary of the problem, FindMPI looks for ""-l"" options on the command line needed for MPI programs.  However some systems end up with default compilers of, say ""x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++"".  The regex logic in the module picks up on the ""-linux-gnu-g++"" part, and tries to add it as a link option... which is of course garbage.
There's a CMake patch available to fix this:
http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-util/cmake/files/cmake-2.8.1-mpi.patch?view=markup
We could apply the patch as we build CMake, as one solution.  Is there a way we can clone FindMPI in our tree and apply the patch there, though?  That'd be nicer because it'd allow an external cmake install to be used.

I have a session file with three files with specific readers specified, visit can not open one of the three but then continues to try with other readers.

The last file being read is going to throw InvalidFilesException - which is correct.
VisIt imported a session from: /Projects/VisIt/trunk/src/LineSampler.session.Shortly thereafter, the following occured...VisIt could not read from the file ""/Projects/latex_it"".The generated error message was:There was an error opening /Projects/latex_it. It may be an invalid file. VisIt tried using the following file format readers to open the file: MDSplus
However, then for unknown reasons VisIt tries to open the file using the H5Nimrod reader not once but twice.
First errant reading:
Shortly thereafter, the following occured...VisIt cannot read the SIL for the file ""/Projects/latex_it"" on host localhost.The metadata server returned the following message:There was an error opening /Projects/latex_it.

Second Errant reading:
Shortly thereafter, the following occured...VisIt could not read from the file ""/Projects/latex_it"".The generated error message was:There was an error opening /Projects/latex_it.

Then, after trying to examine the Active source list, it tries all of the readers in the preferred list twice. (Error below)
VisIt could not read from the file ""/Projects/latex_it"".The generated error message was:There was an error opening /Projects/latex_it. It may be an invalid file.VisIt tried using the following file format readers to open the file: GTC, H5Nimrod, H5Part, M3D, M3DC1, VsIf you know the specific format reader VisIt should use toread this data, you can use Open As...

So it would seem that if a reader is specified in a restored session file and it fails then VisIt should quit rather than trying other readers?????
Next, it seems that the active source list is screwed up because of the above error. The active source list shows one file: siesta_cdx.silo.h5 which would appear to have been opened correctly because multiple plots are drawn based on it.
However, ""File Info"" say there are no open files. Further, ""Plots Add"" is deactivated. So at least there is consistency in VisIt being wrong.
It is possible to reopen the file siesta_cdx.silo.h5 and have the ""File Info"" correct and the ""Plots Add"" active.
Finally, visit continues to try and open the file and reports the error - it needs to quit.

Greg Burton (burton29@llnl.gov) reported that VisIt takes a long time to start up when starting VisIt in a directory with tens of thousands of files. He observed that ""ls"" is also slow and thinks our use of ""ls"" may be the problem. He mentioned that ""\ls"" doesn't have this problem. Here is his e-mail:
Hi Eric, Brad and Cyrus,
Do you recall each of you helping me with the very long hangs I was experiencing when I tried starting up VisIt?  We tried a bunch of things, none of which worked.  I think Ive found the problem, at least a likely cause of the problem, which may suggest a path to fixing it.
All of my work is with very large parallel computing, which typically generates tens of thousands of files in any given directory.  When I launch VisIt in those directories with all those files, VisIt hangs for a long time (typically minutes, not seconds).  When I launch in a parent directory with few files, it starts up like a charm.  I note that the operating system on the LC machines hangs for minutes at a time when I do simple unix commands like ls, etc in those file-heavy directories.  It simply cant go through all those file quickly.   I suspect that during start-up VisIt is using some unix command that the system cant process in any reasonable time.
Given that VisIt is a great tool for parallel post-processing, it seems like a major bug that it cant start up in a reasonable amount of time in precisely those directories where a massive number of files exist from large parallel runs.
Just a thought.
Best,Greg
Here is a follow on e-mail:
What about adding an initial backslash character before the unix command (like: \ls) in your VisIt start-up routines?  I do this when I want a listing of the directory files without the long hangs for the regular ls command to complete.

Mike Barad requests that .visit files support wildcards and a mechanism to say that the entire file is a single timestep.
For the first case, notably that ""!NBLOCKS ALL"" be interpreted to mean that all of the files listed are different blocks from the same timestep.  This would mean users don't have to count the number of files they have for this simple case.
Secondly, he would like to expand wildcards within filenames in the file.  For example, ""*.vtk"" would be interpreted to mean all of the VTK files in the directory which the .visit file resides.

Hi,
Jeremy suggested putting this in as a bug report.
I am reading in a .silo Pointmesh and would like to first do a Molecule plot and then use the CreateBonds operator on it. Right now the Molecule plot works, but when I apply CreateBonds directly it gives me the following error:
Molecule:  ()viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: Expected a vtkPolyData in the avtCreateBondsFilter.
Jeremy then suggested adding the 'External Surface' operator beforehand, which resolves the problem.
However, as a user I would not have found out about this by myself and maybe you could automatize the underlying process such that I only need to apply the CreateBonds operator.

The current infrastructure used the point entered by the user to determine a node or point index and then uses that node or point over time.

Hello,This is probably similar to the bug that I reported earlier here:https://email.ornl.gov/mailman/htdig/visit-users/2008-June/000331.html
The summary: when I have multiple database selected, the numbering in the ""Selected Files"" and ""Active Plots"" are not consistent with each other. However this only happen with in certain situation; I suspect it has something to do with the naming of directory where I put the files.
Here are simple steps to reproduce the problem:1. Create two directory ""output"" and ""output-1""
2. Put a SILO file into those directory (I think it doesn't matter what the file is, it could be the same file). Let's suppose the file is example.silo
3. From VisIt, select ""output/example.silo"" and ""output-1/example.silo"" only
4. Open the first one, and plot something. Here you should see that the number on the ""Active Plots"" doesn't match the number on the ""Selected File""
5. Click on the the second one (it should be output-1/example.silo), hit Overlay. Now the the another plot shows up on the ""Active Plots"", but the number is wrong.
Attached is a screenshot of my VisIt when this happen. On the screenshot, I display the full filename name also in the Pseudocolor legend to be clear. You'll see that the Pseudocolor legend filename and ""Selected Files"" are consistent, but not the ""Active Plots"" (i.e. the numbering in the Active Plots is a mismatch).

Note  the latter issue in this report is serious. All the strcmp calls in silo_f.c can get it wrong.
I think it is not possible to have a DBSetCompression(0) orDBSetCompression(NULL) from the Fortran API since DBSETCOMPRESS_FCchecks the compression string is not DB_F77NULLSTRING and that it islong enough.I would prefer to have:<<        if (strcmp(cvalue, DB_F77NULLSTRING) < 0 && *lcvalue > 0)            cval = SW_strndup(cvalue, *lcvalue);
DBSetCompression(cval);

so that providing either DB_F77NULLSTRING or a negative length resetsthe compression.

By the way, DB_F77NULLSTRING = ""NULLSTRING"" is made of 10 characters, sostrcmp(cvalue, DB_F77NULLSTRING) provides 1 when the user providedDB_F77NULLSTRING !It would be more suitable to declare ""character*10 DB_F77NULLSTRING"" rather than as a character*12, or to compare the result of strcmp with<0 rather than != 0.

1. Open bigsil.silo2. Add a Pseudocolor plot of dist and Draw it3. Change the view so that you can better see all axes4. Open the Annotation window5. On the 3D tab, set all axis titles so they use the ""custom title"" and set   the titles to X, Y, Z, respectively and apply.6. Look at the axis titles in the vis window and notice how the fonts stay    the same size but the ""-Axis"" part of the label is gone.7. For the Z-axis, set its font scale to 0.5 and apply
The perceived problem now is that all of the axis titles get resized thatthe X and Y labels are large than the Z label, making the user think thatsetting the Z label had an effect on the X and Y labels.
The real problem is that the titles determine their default height based onthe width of the string used to set the title. This makes short strings havetaller default heights than longer strings. By setting the titles to shortstrings in #5 and not having the axes recalculate their heights then is theproblem. Had the axes recalculated their heights upon receiving new stringsthen changing the font scale later would have had the desired effect.
Of course, setting font heights based on the widths of the string is not avery good practice.

A user reported that he was able to get VisIt's gui to exit due to exceptions. The culprit is using FileServerList::GetMetaData from tons of locations and not catching exceptions. GetSIL causes the same problem.
We either need to catch the exceptions within those routines and return NULL or add exception handling code to the functions that use GetMetaData/GetSIL.

With 2.1.1, I keep occasionally having instances where my VisIt will
partially die with a message about a Qt exception having occurred.  I
then have to control-C out of the program and restart it.  I haven't
reported this, since I did not have a clear reproducer, but now I do.  I
will attach some logs - let me know if you want others or a run with
different debugging.  I am running a downloaded executable with a local
gui and a remote engine.
In the attached case, the failure occurs when I move the time slider
from the last good file (chk_0032) to a bad file (chk_0033), which is an
HDF5 FLASH file, which was only partially written when the simulation
timed out.  So you might well say ""Well then don't do that!"", but I am
thinking that, while this should have failed, it should have perhaps
gone down more gracefully...
Thanks,

When I make a contour plot (2D data, rectilinear uniform mesh) with 'colorByMultipleColors' of data whose values are very small (e.g. density values of 1.0e-24), then all contours use the lowest contour's colour.  So they are all red in the default scheme.  The only way around this is to rescale the density so that the values are of order unity.  I guess there must be some floating point problem where the colour value is rounding down to zero.  The actual contours display fine in the correct location -- their position is unaffected by the rescaling.

Since Ive already taken the slice, Id like to get the actual extents, not the original ones.
If you record taking the spatial extents with original data, it records the following: Query(""SpatialExtents"", 0, 0, ""default"")If you record taking the spatial extents with actual data, it records the following: Query(SpatialExtents, 1, 0, default)
However, pasting the command Query(SpatialExtents, 1, 0, default) into the command line will give you spatial extents for the original data.  The correct command for the actual data is Query(SpatialExtents,1,default).  This happens on other commands, too, not only Spatial Extents.

The Fortran wrapper file include/silo.inc has a slight problem when the compiler parses source code in F90 ""free"" format (as opposed to F77 fixed format).  Unlike in prior versions, a few lines around line 200 are longer than the magic f77 cutoff (column 72 or whatever).  So they get wrapper, but in the fixed-format way (putting a C in column like 5).
If you're including silo.inc into an F90 project, this makes the compiler upset.
Can you please add a F90 / free format compatible version of the file?  For now, none of the lines are so long that they need to be wrapper at all for F90 format (I think there still is a column limit but it's like 132).
I made my own version of silo.inc that works w/ f90, which I'm happy to share.  It just took 20 seconds of editing.  If something like this could be included in the standard release it would save a few headaches.

I think  we should consider adding a field in avtDataAttributes that would allow savingthe isovalues as doubles to prevent conversion problems later in the pipeline.

This was the result of a long discussion with Matt O'Brien.
He needs to compare results from different simulation runs. Sometimes the runs timesteps do not always line up at exactly the same moments in time. He'd like some way to rule out diffs that are due to slight differences in time (but whihc would have otherwise been the 'same' if the two runs of the simulation were on the same trajectory) from diffs that are due to other things. He proposed having VisIt do linear interpolation between timesteps.
At first, I balked on this because I think linearly interpolating between restart or plot dumps would result in garbage data as those dumps are never at the a fine enough time resolution that they are not hugely understampled. But then, talking with Matt, we considered the case where the dumps are indeed at the highest time resolution of the code (e.g. every main cycle) at least around the target times of some other run. So, for example, the 'old' simulation could have times of 0.5, 2.33 and 3.7 and the 'new' simulation has a few high time resolution dumps around each of those times. In that case, linearly interpolating through time between the high-res dumps to produce a result at a prescribed time to match an older code's dumps could be very useful.
In addition, not all phenomena modled in a simulat is highly variant in time. For example, maybe the pressure variable is highly time-varying but the mesh nodal positions are not. This would mean interpolating mesh geometry might be ok while interpolating pressure might yield garbage.
At any rate, we have a request for VisIt to linearly interpolate between time states.

This was requested by Al Nichols.
In his Silo input databases, he defines a slew of fairly complicated expressions involving intermediate expressions as well as a handful of driving constants. He would like to be able to edit the handful of driving constants without having to be exposed to the slew of complicated expressions they are involved in. This involves managing visibility of the expressions in both the GUI menu pull-downs and in the expression window and editability of these expressions.
Editability
Currently, expressions from the database are not editable. The user would like the ability to edit db expressions. However, the user would like the ability for the database to indicate if a db expression is editable or not. This would involve a Silo enhancement to tag which expressions are editable. It would involve minor adjustments to avtDBMetaData to carry along this tag to Expression window. Note that editability implies visibility. In order to edit an expression from the database, it must be visible in the expression window too. Currently, we have a single check box in expression window which indicates whether to show ALL db expressions or not. The new behavior would be that any db expression which is editable would always appear in the expression window, regardless of the 'show db expressions' check box setting.
Visibility
Visibility of expressions involves two parts; their appearance in the expression window itself and their apperance in the GUI's pull-down menus (or CLI's DBMetaData I guess). Visibility in the expression window would be handled as described above - if its editible, it is always visible otherwise its visible only when the check box to show db expressions is active. The user would like the ability to indicate if expression (variable defined by it actually) appears in the GUI pull-downs or not. For intermediate expression definitions, the resultant pollution of GUI pull-downs is not acceptable. Current best work-around is to define all in a submenu.
There is a separate Silo ticket, #541, for specifying which db expressions should be editable.

This is perhaps a clearer statement of #535. So, perhaps #535 should be closed. Again, the user requesting this is Al Nichols.
The user has a Silo database in which are defined long, complex expressions inolving other long, complex intermediate expressions. Only a few of the terms in these expressions does he ever want/need to edit during a VisIt session.
So, the enhancement could be satisfied by adding some new expression parsing delimiters to delimit the beginning and ending of editable portions of db expressions. In the expression window, if show expressions from db is true, those expressions with editable regions are shown in some color other than greyed out. When they are selected, what you get is a simple list of the editable regions of the expression which one can then select and edit.

GetAnnotationObject accepts either a string name of the object or an integer index. However, the integer index mechanism is broken.
If I run with the GUI and define annotation objects via the GUI, then those objects do not appear in the integer index list of objects defined by CLI's CreateAnnotationObject method. If you mix use of GUI and CLI's CreateAnnotationObject, your integer indices will return unexpected results.
Best thing to do is remove integer index based appraoch and use only string name approach. Not sure what impact that'll have on existing .py code.

Silo allows you to store expressions in a file. It allows you to 'edit' them if you want to also. Just read 'em, change their defintions and write 'em back out. Thats constrained to operate in the same way as all other Silo object edits; the object has to fit into the same or smaller space in the file. But, editing the expression stored in a Silo file is NOT what this enhancement is about.
Its about hinting to a viz. tool like VisIt that the user would like the ability to edit the expressions in the tool's GUI. In VisIt, this would mean that the expression would not honor the check box in VisIt's expression window to show or not show db expressions. It would always be shown and it would never be greyed out.

Third party libraries built as DLL's on Windows often need a preprocessor definition added so that the correct symbols can be imported.Currently, the necessary defines are encapsulated in our xml2cmake tool (GenerateCMake.h).
Eric pointed out that this adds effort when adding a new third-party library, as not everyone might realize that our generation toolneeds to be modified as well.
This information should probably be created as a new cmake var in the Find modules. xml2cmake would then only parse those variables.
Eg. FindHDF5.cmake would add HDF5_DEFINES(HDF5USEDLL) for Windows builds.

It looks to me like we are building a lot more of VisIt than is necessary for parallel-specific targets. For example, there are about 110 database plugins but only 22 appear to have 'PAR_' or 'MPI_' in them. Nonetheless, it looks like we are building all 110 for both serial and parallel. I think similar holds for plots and operators and maybe even VisIt's internal libs. We didn't used to do this. We kept separate lists of targets with parallel-specific code. And, if we were still doing that, I think we'd compile both serial and parallel faster than we do now.

In reviewing code for Namescheme utility class, I think it is doing something horribly inefficient. It is tearing down and re-building the expression tree with each attempt to evaluate a name from the namescheme. After it builds the expression tree, it should store it and re-build it only if namescheme is changed.

553,Pending,Feature,Normal, Cache results from EEF ,-,-,-,Hank Childs,01/11/2011,,0%,12.00 hours,01/11/2011 03:16 pm,01/13/2011 06:44 pm,,,2.12.3,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"
The purpose of this submission is to document what it will take to get the expression evaluator filter (EEF) to cache its results.As I see it, there are two major questions:(1) what should be cached?(2) when should we try to store/fetch arrays in the cache?
As far as (1), my thought is that we should only cache items that are outputted from the EEF.  If we try to cache intermediate objects, we run the risk of blowing the cache.As far as (2), my thought is that we add logic to the beginning and end of EEF::Execute().  The logic at the beginning will check to see which domains have been loaded for this processor and then check to see if any of the final expressions are available in the cache.  If so, then it needs to create a new pipeline to execute, removing the unnecessarily filters corresponding to the cached expression.  The logic at the end would simply add the produced expressions to the cache.
There are some downsides to the suggestion to #2.  When the EEF modifies the contract, it requests all variables it believes are necessary to construct the expression.  If the expression is actually cached, none of those variables need to be ""loaded"".  I put ""loaded"" in quotes b/c those variables were already read from disk and should be in cache (or else we couldn't have calculated the expression in the first place!).  So I don't view this to be a huge downside, especially because we don't recalculate extents any more.  The reason I think it needs to be done in this manner is that it will be tough to know what is available in the cache before the EEF::Execute ... we need to the load balancer to run and tell us what domains our MPI task should process.  Failing that, we don't know whether the expression is actually calculated on all domains, since that information is distributed over many processors.

555,Pending,Feature,Normal, Replace grow-without-bound Cache with LRU Cache w/pre-emption ,-,-,-,Mark Miller,01/12/2011,,0%,,01/12/2011 02:09 pm,02/02/2011 07:35 pm,,,2.12.3,4 - High,4 - Common,All,Any,"
In VisIt, we are not doing any least recently used (lru) w/pre-emption type of caching. We allow the cache to grow and grow and grow, hoping that that whatever the user is doing, there will always be enough memory for the current timestep. We clear the cache(s) whenever we change timesteps.
When timesteps are small enough to fit several in mem. We don't. In that case, switching timesteps between the several that could possibly fit in cache results in constant re-reads and re-computes of stuff that could otherwise be cached.
When a single timestep's inputs plus related items cached using the current mechanism and policies grows too large to fit in memory, we entirely run out of memory and suffer an engine crash. Instead, we could simply wind up pre-empting and then re-reading and/or re-computing pre-empted items thereby avoiding an engine crash.
Currently, in our new-handler in the engine, we have no way to identify what things we could reasonably free up as we have no idea from among the items in the cache, which have been more recently used or not.
If we had some LRU based mechanism with pre-emption, then some of the questions about when to cache or what to cache would be replaced by a single question, how big a cache do we need? We would cache as necessary, expecting that that whenever we reach the limit of memory for cache, we pre-empt (e.g. remove) something old, freeing space for the new thing. Even if we wound up freeing and then re-constituting stuff, because the existing cache size limit is not sufficient for the operation(s), that is far better than crashing an engine. Though, if we wound up with extreme thrashing, that may not be any better than crashing. However, even in that case, we'd at least be able to detect it, halt the execution appropriate and issue a warning message instead of just crashing.
I am told the trick is in computing amount of memory used by any thing we aim to cache. We are typically caching VTK objects or AVT objects that have VTK objects within them. And, VTK objects share other VTK objects. So, computing the memory usage may be tricky. In addition, removing objects where there are complex VTK interdependencies may also be challenging. But,

I've experienced some weird crashes when using VisIt 2.2b at LC with simulations that have double-precision coordinates. Usually in totalview, I end up with a stack I do not understand. I was able to get a stack today implicating transform manager. It turns out that my sim did have double coordinates for a rectilinear grid. Jin reported a similar failure once for ale3d and I had worked around it in a different way.
When I changed my coordinates back to float, the sim did not crash.
I'm thinking for now I should do double->float conversion in the SimV2 reader just to be safe. Another thing I could try is to make sure a DB plugin returns double coordinates to see what VisIt does.

He does not want to use bounding-box mode as that makes his picture disappear, and he needs to see the picture in order to determine the correct direction/amount of rotation.
For example, a right-arrow key press would rotate in the x direction 1 pixel (or whatever incrementhad been specified).

This could be a global action, for all settings data, checked once at shutdown, or could be done per kind of setting, when the particular window is dismissed or closed.

Andreas Schafer would like this for silo (and VisIt).I think this would be less than 1/2-days work on Silo library and Siloplugin in VisIt. We'd add a DBOPT_GHOST_CELL_ARRAY option forDBPutQuadmesh. It would be an array of chars of the same size as mesh.Non-zero value for a cell indicates its a ghost while zero valueindicates its a real cell.
In the Silo plugin for VisIt, when we read a quadmesh object, we'd seeif this optional array exists and, if so, ghost the mesh according to itinstead of the 'normal' way. The plugin already does ghosting based onhi/lo offsets (around the extreme boundaries of a quadmesh). All thiswould do is add explicit ghosting. I think as long as the ghostingpattern you needed for a particular quadmesh did not result in (a lotof) internal holes (your 2D example had no actual holes in any of thepieces), then most of the issues with 'internal faces' due to ghostingdon't really crop up.
Note, there is a slight gotcha getting browser to display this data correctly. It doesn't know how to compute the array size properly.
Hank thinks this might have other useful application as well.

We're including 'silo_exports.h' in score.h, a PDB-Lite source. I don't think we should do that. But, I think I am hung up on the name of the include file having 'silo' in it. All silo_exports.h really has in it is the windows-specific logic to correctly export symbols with the SILO_API macro.
I thought about putting this into config.h instead. That would be fine except that silo_exports logic needs to appear in silo.h too. So, that would mean that #include'ing silo.h in a source file would also include Silo's config.h. That would be bad as that would mean symbols specific to internal compilation of the Silo library then pollute any Silo client's CPP namespace. If we could find a way that config.h is essentially 'empty' when its included in a true silo client, then that would fix this issue.
I don't understand enough about silo_exports to know whether its a message down to the lib to do something with SILO_API'd symbols or a message up to caller of Silo library telling it which symbols are really defined for it to reference.

The resulting plot should show ""123."" for all X labels and ""38."" for all Y labels. Should it do better?
When I play with some annotation settings, I can get the labels to look better. 1. Turn off ""Auto scale label values"" in the Annotation window's 3D->General 3D tab2. Set the X and Y label ""Scaling (x10^?)"" value to 1 and then back to 0, applying each time
If I turn on ""Auto scale label values"" again, the labels remain more accurate. I'd say the 3D axes are not being regenerated often enough since some of these settings don't cause them to change once they've changed.

Ok, I think I wasn't describing the situation clearly enough.
1. Someone's commit to trunk updates check_dos and count_tabs hooks.2. The 'magic' happened and the hooks got installed. All is good.3. I merged from trunk to my branch.4. I picked up the changes to check_dos and count_tabs hooks in mybranch.5. I commit my the merge of trunk to my branch.6. The changes to check_dos and count_tabs on my branch went along forthe ride as they should.7. The magic happened and those hooks got installed again, a second timeonly this time from a commit on my branch.
Now, branch work should not affect the trunk until it is finally mergedto trunk. I have not merged my branch to trunk, yet my changes (mergesfrom trunk really) to hooks got installed, effecting ALL COMMITS.
I guess all I am saying is that what occurred in step 2 is correct butthe second time in step 7 is suspect; both because it is coming from acommit on a branch and because it is essentially re-installing alreadyinstalled hooks. In this case, the files are identical (I didn't changeexplicitly the hooks in my branch) so no negative effects reallyoccurred.
As long as there is no need for a branch's hooks to be different thantrunk, then I guess all that really happens is unnecessaryre-installation of the same hooks during commits to branches. But, ifsomeone really does modify a branch's hooks to be different than trunkthen there is room for a serious problem; the 'installation' of hookswritten for a specific branch. Once they are 'installed' they effect ALLCOMMITS ANYWHERE, not just the branch.
Now, it is not impossible to have branch-specific hook behavior workcorrectly. One just has to code the hook to look for specific branchnames and then 'do the right thing' for the branch in question. But,lets suppose someone does that on a branch, commits it and it works fora while. But, then someone comes along on trunk with a change to a hook.Since the branch has not been merged to trunk, the change and commit ofthe hook there will 'stomp out' the hook that got committed from thebranch and the branch-specific behavior will be lost until it iscommitted from the branch again. But then that'll stomp out the updatedtrunk behavior. etc., etc.,
I think the only way to operate is whenever developers need to modifyhooks, they do so on the TRUNK ONLY. Even if they need behavior that isbranch-specific, they should adjust the hooks on the trunk and committhem from there. Hooks should never be installed on a commit to abranch. I think I should add logic to the 'magic' installation script tocheck and only allow it to occur on trunk.
Sorry for the long-winded email and belaboring such a subtle issue.

I have produced a small FLASH file which can be used to investigate this bug.  Take the attached file, chk_0000.flash, and also copy it to the name chk_0001.flash.  Using smart grouping, open the database of these two files.  Choose a pseudocolor of the first variable, ""dens"", and also choose a single slice operator.  Press the draw button.  Then move the time slider to the right.  You probably will find that the right half of the plot has disappeared. Move the time slider back to step 0.  Go back and forth 2 more times, and the compute engine will abort.  This was with a downloaded x86_64 executable of version 2.2.0.  I believe it has been doing this for a while, though.  As Tomasz Plewa pointed out of the visit-users list, these problems can be avoided by hitting the ""Clear Cache"" button before moving the time slider.  (On the visit-developers list, Brad (https://email.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-developers/2011-January/008783.html) asked if this may be a symptom of reuse of a cached domain nesting object.)
P.S. - Out of a foolish consistency, I would suggest editting signalhandler_core in src/common/misc/DebugStreamFull.C to say ""SIGABRT"" instead of ""SIGBRT""...
P.P.S. - During these tests, I noticed that there is no <FilePatterns> section in FLASH.xml, so that there is no way to auto-recognize FLASH files by extension.  This might be intended, since the FLASH program does not, by default append an extension...

This is due to the fact that VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT uses the FORCE option, and our config-site filesare reread with each cmake-iteration, thus re-forcing whatever options are in the config-site files.

I was doing a study where I was ray-casting a 4B cell problem with 64 processors.  I observed that there was a ""Synchronize"" phase at the end that was lasting 6 seconds -- an appreciable amount of the entire time.
I attached with a debugger and found that the entire data set was being serialized and passed around between the processors.  Each processor was sending another a 271MB message in an effort to decide whether or not we should enter scalable rendering mode.
I have two comments:(1) when we ray cast volume renderer, we shouldn't have to determine if we exceed the SR threshold.(2) in the normal case (the geometry case), it seems like we should have a phase where we collect only triangle counts before we actually start sending data.
I am marking the Severity as Crash, since I have seen some occasions where we run out of memory and I now think that it is related to this behavior.

open c004.curvePut up both parabolic and going_down curves and draw both.Now, hide and unhide the going_down plot. The view extents change back and forth to accomodate either just the parabolic (going_down hidden) or both. Thats fine.
Ok, what if I don't want to the view to change? What do I do? I see Controls->View->Curve and don't see anything there to affect that. I try advanced tab. There I see 'locked view' 'maintain view limits' 'viewe based on pull down orig/actual spatial extents.' Boy all these kinda sorta sound like what I want. But what the heck are the differences between these?
First, I try 'view based on...' and use actual extents and hit apply. Now, hiding/unhiding going_down has no effect on view. It seems to me that its effectively locked. Why? I set view based on 'actual' so I thought that as I hide/unhide, the 'actual' extents would change and the view would change. So, I go back to 'original'. But, hiding/unhiding going_down still has no effect. Its like the view is totally locked now, why? I didn't lock it.
I hit 'reset view' with both plots UNhidden. Now, seems like I am back to where I started. The view now changes as I hide/unhide going_down.
Next, I trie 'lock view' when both plots are UNhidden and hit apply. Now, view stays the same as I hide/unhide going_down. Ok, so now I uncheck 'locked view' and hit apply, expecting it to return to old behavior of changing view as I hide/unhide going_down. Well, it nothing changes. Unlocking the view seems to have had no effect.
I hit 'reset view' with both plots UNhidden and hit apply. Nothing changes, as I hide/unhide going_down, view stays constant. 'reset view' is having no effect now.
I now delete the plots and re-create them but in reverse order. Now, going_down is first and parabolic second. Now, I get back to the behavior I had before. As I hide/unhide going_down, view changes. Ok.
Now I check 'maintain view limits' and hit apply. Now, as I hide/unhide going_down, view does not change. Gee, that seems a lot like 'locked view'. Why are there two check boxes for the same behavior? Oops, but wait, I uncheck 'maintain view limits' and hit apply. But, as I hide/unhide going_down, view does not change.
For curve views, the intent of these advanced controls is unclear. Maybe for curve views some of the controls are synonymous, in which case, they maybe should be gray'd out. But, the GUI itself is confusing. On top of that, the behavior is inconsistent and seems to depend on the order of plots in the plot list, the order of hide/unhide and what is hidden or unhidden at the time of setting view, etc.
Finally, this was submitted because Matt O'Brien did not want 'reset view' in curve mode to include curves that were hidden in the resetted view extents.

If you open a file with a transformed rectilinear grid, picking on it simply reports that there were no intersections.
For example, open trunk/data/CHGCAR (it's a sub-format of the VASP reader, but it should choose VASP automatically these days), make a pseudocolor plot, and try zone or node pick, and for the most part it doesn't report any
I thought I'd made this work before.  If so, I believe it would have been possible to create a pick test case for it, but I don't believe I did.  It would be really smart to add one when we fix this.
If this didn't work, then we should probably add support for it, though the priority isn't the same if it's not something that ever worked.

One of silo's tests, compression.c, is intended to drive hdf5 in various ways using compression, etc.However, it uses only DBWrite() calls and there isn't logic in the HDF5 driver to handle setting of dxpl for H5Dwrite calls for that function. Now, even funnier is the fact that somehow, the compression test still winds up compressing datasets that get written. So, I am guessing that somehow the property list for dataset transfer (or maybe creation) is getting left around in a set-for-compression state and that is how H5Dwrite calls are ultimately getting compression applied.
The minratio1000 test fails. I had thought the problem was in HDF5. However, it fails to write data correctly. The problem is that Silo does not detect and report the failed write even with errmode set to FAIL.
Ok, I figured out why a Silo DBWrite call, although having no specific logic to handle compression, still winds up getting compressed. There are some hid_t pointers to dataset creation properties in the driver; P_crprops and P_ckcrprops. All ccompression stuff is handled via P_ckcrprops. But, under various conditions, P_crprops, which is otherwise H5P_DEFAULT, gets set equal to P_ckcrprops and then never gets set back. So, P_ckcrprops then effects any H5Dcreate call thereafter that uses P_crprops.

Steve Langer pointed out that this request regarding something like what Vamsee referred to as 'htpurl vfd' (a slight swizzle on core vfd), would also be good for a particular parallel I/O setting; read WHOLE file on one processor and broadcast to all others. Proc 0 would use core vfd to 'read' it, get the pointer to the 'core' file, and broadcast that whole chunk of bytes. All other procs would just sit in broadcast, and upon getting the bytes, open the 'core' driver on those bytes.


So, I am thinking there would be a good 'new' vfd to define for parallel HDF5 too for this. Of course, it would be for read-only setting I think. Maybe read-write could be made to work but that is not a requirement/need and if it was ever attempted, I think it would be ok to limit to...
	
overwrites of data already existing in file
a small number of writers and writes

For parallel HDF5, I am not sure what you'd call this beast of a vfd but I am certain it would be very useful to parallel codes using HDF5's parallel interface in this way.
Of course, you could stay away from parallel HDF5 (and the MPI part of it) and NOT have HDF5 able to do all that 'magic'. Then, application is responsible for acquiring buffer on proc 0, broadcasting and then calling (serial) HDF5 on each proc to 'open' that buffer of bytes. In fact, that might be best just to leave it, and then just add a parallel use case test for this mode as well as a tiny HDF5 tutorial on how to do it.
Of course, you could do BOTH; define the 'open these bytes in core' vfd for serial HDF5 and define the special broadcasting variant of it for parallel HDF5.


Here are the basic requirements from our end.
	
the ability to 'open' an HDF5 'file' existing as a buffer of bytes already in memory.
the ability to obtain a pointer to a buffer of bytes in memory after having 'opened' an HDF5 file with the core vfd.
funtionality cannot be 'bound' to parallel HDF5 only. That is, 1) & 2) should be possible with a serially compiled HDF5.

The other options suggested here (making a convenient parallel vfd, supporting limited writes) are just some nice icing on that cake.

If you open some CHGCAR file (like the CHGCAR file in trunk/data), it's actually a regular grid with a linear transformation applied.

To recreate the issue:- installed binary 2.2.0 release on windows- loaded the galaxy0000.silo visit simple dataset- create a molecule plot of mass- in the plot options, drop the atom size down and change to sphere impostors
At this point it looks fine since it's using local hardware rendering - the imposters have correct z values when they intersect each other.  If you change it to always use scalable rendering, you get the old impostors that are just 2d billboards that stack over each other instead of intersecting correctly.
This bug seems to only appear when using scalable rendering with localhost on windows.  Using a windows client with linux compute nodes appears to work correctly, and linux with localhost SR also seem to work.

Quincey explained to me that compression of floating point data is done by applying a couple of HDF5 filters together; shuffle followed by either zlib or gzip compression. Without having shuffle compressor first, you can't really do too good a job on floating point data compression.
Alas, I don't think this was understood when Silo's compression features were added and I don't think we are doing anything of the sort. This issue needs to be corrected. We could assume that if METHOD=gzip, then for floating point data, we always stuff a shuffle filter ahead of gzip filter and for int data we don't.

We have the notion of global node numbers for meshes and global zone numbers for zonelists. But, a user came to me with a need for 3 different indexing schemes; a global indexing scheme, a processor-local scheme and a chunk or material-local scheme. This is a slipper slope. But, there is a simple enhancement we could add to handle this. We can add an option for a silo variable to be tagged as an indexing variable. This would be the clue to a viz. tool like VisIt that it should be used as an optional way to index nodes/zones in things like label plot and in picks/query.

A user has Silo data in which he'd like to maintain multiple different indexing schemes; global nodes, domain-local, material/chunk-local. These can be handled in Silo as mesh variables like any other mesh variable. However, its important for VisIt to know a given variable is suitable for indexing purposes as it serves as a candidate for label plot of mesh to use for node numbers/zone numbers as well as pick/query to return. Its more automated than having user have to specify the particular variables to be used for indexing.

When a dataset's dimensions are fixed, and the same as the chunk dimensions, the library ""knows"" that the dataset will only have one chunk.

Hello all,
I have a dataset with multiple time steps and an unstructured mesh plus two scalar variables, say X and Y. Both X and Y are constant over the full domain.
What I would like to get is a single X-Y curve over all time steps.I actually achieved nearly that by creating query-over-time plots after picking a random point for both X and Y, then exporting the resulting curves as 'curve' data, opening that file and finally doing a scatter plot. However, I only get points and no curve this way and I am pretty sure there must be an easier way, or not...?
Thanks,Cihan

I told him that he could then parse the 2 curve files to generate a newcurve file with X vs Y.
The whole process could be made easier and the last step could be madeeasier. Is there some new paradigm that would make this entire class ofproblem simpler?

A couple of users have reported a problem generating movies of curves using parallel VisIt. The curve gets truncated vertically. I can reproduce with the following steps on 8 processors of alastor but fewer than 8 processors does not exhibit the error. Thus, the problem might be due to how reduce happens in MPI when we composite frame buffers from different processors. I haven't looked at each processor's frame buffer.
1. Run visit on alastor2. Open curve_test_data/curve.visit (data from the test suite)3. Select a parallel profile with 8 processors4. Make a Curve plot of parabola and Draw5. Advance to the last time step6. Go through the Save movie wizard and save PNG files
The resulting images will have missing curve pixels once the parabola gets above the bottom 25% or so of the image. This looks like an image compositing problem.
I didn't notice the problem being dependent on image size or which curve rendering method was used. I used symbols, wide lines, etc. in different tests and each test had the curve truncated at about 25% up from the image bottom.

I am guessing I am responsible for a majority of these. If so, its probably due to my own ignorance in their impact. However, I've recently become concerned about having 'using std::...' statements in header files as that winds up effecting whatever cames after it in whatever source file it is included. This is particularly bad for header files from libraries that other applications are intended to link with. So, I think we should remove all instances of this in VisIt. I've grep'd for them and found many. I listed as a major irritation because if it is ever a problem, its would to be a bear to track down if you were not specifically aware of it.

parallel engine will crash.
Seems in part due to OnionPeel's use of vtkDataSetRemoveGhostCells.commenting-out use of the filter allows OnionPeel to complete, but gives differentresults than when run in serial.
Restructuring the code a bit:old:   ds = removeGhostCells->GetOutput();   ds->Update();new:   removeGhostCells->Update();   ds = removeGhostCells->GetOutput();
also removes the crash, but OnionPeel can fail with bad index.eg. try seed cell of 97, which works in serial but in parallelyields bad index error saying max is 49.

Michael, Brad, thank you for your comments.
However, it will be interesting to hear which data formats could provide information about block connectivity (ghost zones) to VisIt for multiblock grids?
Silo, VTK, what else?
--Best regards,Boris Krasnopolsky
I think it would actually be a good idea if we documented what features are supported in what readers. We could probably have a table that lists key features and then links to more information about restrictions, etc. We don't need to do this for every reader. If it isn't know, we could just put that in. I believe it would reduce support e-mails.

This is for two users; Al Nichols and Randy Settgast.
It has to do with material (region) specific variables. That is, variables in Silo that exist on only some materials. The DBOPT_REGION_PNAMES option of var objects in Silo is used to control this. The orig. design was intended for this option to list all relevant material names a variable was defined on (e.g. restricted to). However, there are drivers for both Al and Randy in which it is highly desireable to write one ucdvar object per-material. I consider this an abuse of the feature. At any rate, to support this case, writers will construct a multi-var of multi-vars.
At the domain level, write all the region-specific ucd vars you want. Also, at that level, create a multi-var object that points at an (arbitrarily long) list of such ucdvars.
There will be two levels of multivars; the normal 'top-level' stuff which will have one entry per domain as you've always done and the domain-level multi-var which will have one entry per region-specific ucdvar.
But, there will be a DBOPT_REGION_PNAMES option on multivars AT BOTH LEVELS; the top-level and the domain-level. In addition, that option will include the 'union of all region (material) names' the variable is defined on. Top-level is more important than domain level. It prevents VisIt from having to chase all over hell's half acre to get information about the material list the variable is defined on during a file open operation.
In addition, each multivar will have the DBOPT_MMESH_NAME on BOTH LEVELS of multivars. At the top level, it will be the name of the associated multi-mesh. At the domain level, it will be the name of the associated domain-level 'normal' ucdmesh.

The visit-install script has some erroneous logic. Below is an e-mail describing it with a solution.
Hello,
I've been trying to install Visit on my macbook pro core duo (32bits)/ mac OS 10.6.6, using the visit-install script, as written in thereadme file.
I do this :
./visit-install 2.2.1 darwin-i386 ~/visit
the script prints some stuff in the terminal and finishes with this :
667495 blocks64426 blocksfind: /Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin//Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin/gui.app/Contents/MacOS:No such file or directoryfind: /Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin//Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin/mcurvit.app/Contents/MacOS:No such file or directoryfind: /Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin//Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin/viewer.app/Contents/MacOS:No such file or directoryfind: /Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin//Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin/xmledit.app/Contents/MacOS:No such file or directoryvisit-install done
The version I've downloaded is :https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/2.2.1/VisIt-2.2.1-i386-installer.dmg
I think the error comes from the following part of the visit-install code :
if [ ""$os"" = ""darwin"" ]; then    for arch in `ls ""$dir""/$version+`; do        if [ ""$arch"" != ""bin"" ]; then            for app in `find ""$dir""/$version+/$arch/bin -name ""*.app"" -print`; do                find ""$dir""/$version+/$arch/bin/$app/Contents/MacOS-exec chmod $dir_permission {} \;            done        fi    donefi
the $app variable is already a complete absolute path, not the name ofthe .app file as the find command seems to be written for...
The error disappears if the previous lines are replaced by the following :
if [ ""$os"" = ""darwin"" ]; then    for arch in `ls ""$dir""/$version`; do        if [ ""$arch"" != ""bin"" ]; then            for app in `find ""$dir""/$version/$arch/bin -name ""*.app"" -print`; do                find $app/Contents/MacOS -exec chmod $dir_permission {} \;            done        fi    donefi
Unfortunatly, even with this correction, I can't make visit work :
If I click on the 'gui.app' in the finder invisit_directory/2.2.1/darwin-i386/bin/gui.app
the application is launch but seems not responding before starting...(blocked at the initialization window at the begining of the progressbar)
if I run the 'visit' script in the terminal :
[~/visit/bin]$ ./visitVersion 2.2.1 of 'gui' does not exist forthe architecture 'darwin-x86_64'.VisIt located binaries for the following architectures:        darwin-i386
What should I do ?
ThanksNico

Brian Rujiuz and Matt O'Brian requested this.
Currently, Silo places an upper limit on maximum number of concurrently opened files. That number is 256 and it is set at compile time.
First, I have no idea why 256 was chosen. It could be a value that was appropriate for machines that existed when Silo was first being written about 20 years ago.
Most systems place an upper limit on total number of open files (descriptors) at 1024 or above. We can't get around that limit. But, Silo could be modified to use whatever the system limit as its own internal limit instead of a hard-coded 256.

Its becoming more and more frequent that we sometimes need a way for a Silo client to force certain behavior available in a driver specific library (e.g. HDF5).
One option is for callers just to call the driver-specific method directly. However, thats potentially risky as driver-specific behavior may need to properly integrate with Silo in order to function as desired.
A solution is to add a generic DBDriverAction method that takes a file or driver id and an optlist and then performs actions as pre-defined by various optlist options. An example would be telling Silo to work-around HDF5 free-list leaks by calling H5open on an infrequent basis.
In fact, what Silo really needs is a public 'io-context' that sort of operates like a 'stack' and the context includes all 'behaviors' such as friendly names, compression, dis-allowing overwrites, etc., etc. The silo library needs to be able to switch between contexts associated with different files and/or as callers (possibly nested) specify.

I don't think this is an outright leak so I don't think valgrind would report it. Valgrind may report it with its --show-reachable feature. I don't know. However, when we run a problem, opening an HDF5 file and writing tens of thousands of small datasets to it and watch it using 'top', the resisdent set size and virtual size grow without bound. We have a code that is running our of memory routinely because of this. Both HDF5-1.8.4 and 1.8.6 exhibit this behavior regardless of calls to H5set_free_list function. The only work-around is to finalize HDF5 library on a regular basis calling H5open. H5garbage_collect doesn't even fix it.

When trying to install Silo 4.8 from source with --enable-silex, I got the following error:
""configure: WARNING:   Sorry, but you need Qt version 4.4.0 or higher to compile Silo's silex tool. silex is being disabled""
This seemed initially very confusing, since qmake --version told me I have version 4.7.0 of the Qt library, which obviously satisfies the above requirement. I tracked down the problem to a line in the configure-script that looks like (line 27015):--for ver in  4.4.0 4.4.1 4.4.2 4.4.3 4.4.4 4.4.5 \                4.5.0 4.5.1 4.5.2 4.5.3 4.5.4 4.5.5 \                4.6.0 4.6.1 4.6.2 4.6.3 4.6.4 4.6.5 ; do--This list doesn't include the 4.7.0 version, which causes the script to conclude that there is no recent version of the Qt-library. It's a rather trivial, yet very annoying mistake in the build script. Fortunately the fix is easy: just add 4.7.0 to the list of the loop

Ok, I just did a cursory look-see in Silo plugin in VisIt.
Indeed, Quadvar code for single component variables (scalars) is handling major_order feature of a Silo variable.
However, it does not look like same is true for multi-component quadvars (vectors). We don't seem to be doing anything with the major_order feature of a Silo variable then.
So, my quick conclusion is this is a bug in the Silo plugin in VisIt.
From Jakob van Bethlehem...
I'm creating output of my simulations in .silo format and came across a peculiarity when using DBPutQuadvar. I attached a piece of minimum code that reproduces the problem (quadvec2.cc)It produces a simple vector field and a scalar field. Then I create a quadmesh for it and use DBPutQuadvar1 to put the scalar field on the mesh and DBPutQuadvar to put the vector field on the same mesh. In this particular example I use the x-coordinate as the second coordinate when filling the image, which will put the image in the right orientation when using Silo-row major orientation, which seems to be the default (AFAICS the orientation for Silo files as set by DBOPT_MAJORORDER should be thought of with respect to the X-axis, meaning that M[X][Y] will appear right when setting it to 1 (column-major) and M[Y][X] when setting it to 0 (row-major))And indeed, I get the result as in quadvec2_roworder.png, which are the correct results. But let's now change the ordering by setting 'column=1' in the code. This should rotate everything a quarter circle, since we're effectively changing the axes. Now the result is quadvec2_colorder.png The figure shows that the scalar field did rotate, but the vector field didn't (even though, when investigating the .silo output with silex, in the properties of the scalar field the major-ordering is correctly set to column-major (1)! ) Especially because of the latter, I suspect this is actually a bug in VisIt, or the Silo-reader of VisIt, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.
Actually, this wouldn't be too much of a problem, if it weren't for the fact that all my code uses the convention C[X][Y][Z] for datacubes, hence I really need the to set the ordering to column-major for correct visualization.
That mysteriously kept failing and that caused me to bring everything down to the little example program I created, which shows the problem by forcing a 'wrong' visualization.BTW, after finishing all this I note that I don't pass the optionlist to DBPutQuadmesh - there is no reason for this in particular. However, even though I know that the Silo-library is a bit fishy when it comes to passing options to different functions (see eg bug 465), in this case passing the optionlist with the correct ordering set to DBPutQuadmesh does not resolve the problem.
Anyway... I'm curious about the thoughts of other users. And in particular: if this is indeed a bug in VisIt, whether there would be a quick work-around (not involving me rewriting all my code from using C[X][Y][Z] to C[Z][Y][X] please) until the bug is fixed in VisIt??

Below is the e-mail thread describing the issue. It may not be a bug but I didn't want to loose sight of it.
I think I added logic in there at some point, Jeremy, to split for some enhancement that Jeff Keasler requested. I can't remember which now. I probably did it back in ClearCase days and so don't think I have any(useful) logs for changes this old. At any rate, if its a problem its a Silo bug 'cause Silex is coming from Silo now -- even the one delivered with VisIt, I think.

a Qt bug for particularly long ones.  So we changed it to a 
heuristic to split the string at convenient spots for display to make sure it wasn't too wide.

Admittedly, it looks like it's probably splitting a little more

aggressively than it needs to, and it's been a while now, so that 
particular Qt bug is probably fixed and we could probably allow 
wider strings there in general.  Is it causing problems, though?  Or 
did you just want to make sure it wasn't internally interpreting it 
to have newlines?

Subject: [visit-users] Silex peculiarity
Hello everyone,
When exporting a Silo file using DBCreate() with a non-Null 
info-message, the passed string appears with a newline inserted 
at

each

space when inspected in silex.
I created the info.cc example and created a screenshot of the 
result

in

silex (info.png). Why is this happening? Personally I'd say this 
is

a

bug, but would this be a bug in silex or in the Silo-library?
Yours sincerely,
Jakob van Bethlehem

A user was having problems displaying his image as a truecolor plot. After a string of e-mail messages I finally got the file from hit and found that is was a tiff image with all the alpha values zero. So the image was transparent. It would be nice if this was detected and handled automatically. It could either be done in the image reader or in the truecolor plot. I think the true color plot would be slightly better. I guess there could also be an explicit toggle on the truecolor plot to ignore alpha values. The work around is to create a new variable that is ""color(red,green,blue)"".

I just installed a 32-bit windows version of VisIt 2.2.1 on 32-bit WinXP downloaded from here: https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/2.2.1/visit2.2.1.exe <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/2.2.1/visit2.2.1.exe>
After I chose a Single  user(Username) installation option the installation process proceeds flawlessly. The program is then installed in C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Application Data\Programs\LLNL\VisIt 2.2.1 directory.
However the shortcuts created on desktop and in the start menu are not working. They point to ""c:\Program Files\LLNL\VisIt 2.2.1"" as they would if I were to choose All users option instead of Single user(Username).
I think this is a bug, and it should be fixed. Thanks a lot.

When sampling an unstructured grid using lineout, some of the line/cell intersections are producing intersection points that are not on the line. These bad intersection points are causing peaks in the generated curve where there should be no peaks. This problem has been verified by adding code into the avtLineoutFilter::NoSampling method to write out Point3D files of the calculated intersection points. The errant points are not on the expected line when plotted in VisIt.
In the example setup, there is a cube shaped unstructured mesh that has been rotated so its top face points towards (1,1,1). There is a field that varies linearly along the axis of mesh in the (1,1,1) direction. Taking a lineout through the mesh along that axis starting from (0,0,0) should produce a curve plot that also varies linearly. What we see instead is a curve plot that is mostly linear but there are various places along the curve with peaks that should not exist. When you turn on the curve plot's points, you can see that there are clusters of points that have been incorrectly offset in X somehow.

One of the students here finally figured out why images rendered through Tuvok look so much different than the 3D texturer, which it should be largely equivalent to.  Tuvok isn't getting appropriate values for the overall volume size (m_vGlobalSize), which causes it to compute a junk value for the opacity correction factor.  This makes everything excessively 'thin'.

I am attaching a short powerpoint outlining some of the issues (and solutions) that I have encountered plotting ALE-AMR SAMRAI data in VisIt. I seem to have found a (mostly complete) fix for using ghost cells in VisIt with SAMRAI. I am attaching patched code for VisIt (2.2.0) and SAMRAI (2.4.4). As you will see a few issues remain (that may be easily fixed by someone with a deeper knowledge of the inner workings of VisIt than I have) but I hope that the fixes I am sending can find their way into both codes. If anyone would like to look at the data sets that I used to generate the plots the path is: /p/lscratcha/masters6/MSLTest/ (subdirectories msl_impact-2d-00008.visit.old and msl_impact-2d-PGC-00008.visit for the unpatched and patched SAMRAI solutions)

With multiple attempts to open a given file made by autodetection logic, its way too easy to get into situations where a plugin opens an HDF5 file and then neglects to properly close it. This then effects other plugins that try to open and use the same file.
Jeremy has corrected much of this behavior by examining and adjusting code in some HDF5 plugins.
But, best advice from HDF Group is to use the file access property, H5F_CLOSE_SEMI
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetFcloseDegree
when opening the file so that H5Fclose will indeed close the file, regardless of whatever objects a plugin may have left open.

We often have users downloading the wrong binary distribution and then they get confused when they run VisIt and it errors out with a warning like ""Could not find linux-intel version"". I know that some recent improvements were made to the VisIt launcher script that tells it what architectures were installed to help shed some light on the fact that the user installed the wrong version.
I think it might be helpful to include more information on the executables download page that tells the user which binary they need to download for their platform. This might take different forms but listing the VisIt platform id (linux-intel, linux-x86_64, darwin-i386, darwin-x86_64) and so on might help. It might help even more if we provided a small script that would identify which binary they need to download. Not sure which binary you need? This script will tell you. Even better This mainly comes up with the selecting 32 vs 64 bit Linux binaries.
I think that the best solution would be to put in some java script into the web page that can identify the user's OS based on the browser properties. See http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html

Here is Rich Cook's e-mail regarding the documentation.
Actually, that link has what I would call ""generalities"" about svn scripts and development process, mixed with philosophy, theory and other stuff.  I've seen that link before and found it mostly a good place to go to get confused.What would be really useful on the wiki would be a straightforward tutorial on how to actually get work done as a new developer!  :-)
Here are my notes.  Note that it is a ""how to"" and not a ""how it all works in theory"" document:
2010-11-30For a complicated description of this, go to http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Collab:VisItWiki_SVNScripts
The proper way to do this is to check out the current RC branch, e.g.svn co svn+ssh://cook47@svn.nersc.gov/svn/visit/branches/2.2RC/src/databases/paraDIScd paraDIS
To be more complete, you could do this:svn co svn+ssh://cook47@svn.nersc.gov/svn/visit/branches/2.2RC/src/svn_bin./svn_bin/co_rctrunk 2.2RC sdt
I'm not sure what ""sdt"" does, but I think it gets src, databases and test subdirectories.
You are now working on the next release of 2.2.  If 2.2.1 is the current release, you are working on 2.2.2 or something.  Your changes will be in the next release BUT THEY WILL NOT BE ON THE TRUNK, so version 2.3 will NOT include your changes unless you do a ""merge"" into the trunk!
When you have gotten your code in order and are ready to merge them to the trunk, you have to first check out the trunk using the special script (which you can download from svn)
src/svn_bin/co_trunk all
Now merge your new commits on 2.2RC to the trunk:cd trunksrc/svn_bin/merge_rctrunk_to_trunk 2.2RC
You must run merge_rctrunk_to_trunk at the trunk directory.  I.e. ""ls"" should show the ""src"" directory. Assuming you're there and it's still not working, then make sure there are ""trunk/.rootpath"" and ""trunk/.branchname"" files.  If not, then it is because you didn't check out using src/svn_bin/co_trunk.  You can fix it, though.cd trunkecho trunk > .branchnameecho '/' > .rootpath

Say you want to try and guard against a divide by zero:
if(le(value,1e-3),1.0,1.0/value)
This won't work, '1.0/value' is evaluated for all cells and a div by zero warning is generated which prevents the expression from being used.
What I would like to have is:divide(<val_numerator>,<val_denominator>,>div_by_zero_value>)

I was wondering if would be possible to add in the setting of logical bounds in the meta data for silo files that contain structured data. I have some silo data that I would like have the logical bounds presentable to the user. I see places where rectilinear meshes are called out but I just do not have the knowledge to muck about - and given the number of people using the reader it is probably best that I do not. It is fairly easy once you know the logical bounds.
The main call
avtMeshMetaData::SetBounds()
or
replace the first argument (NULL) when calling
avtMeshMetaData *mmd = new avtMeshMetaData(NULL,                                                     extents_to_use, ... );
in the file reader.
It is not critical but I thought it might be nice to have the bounds feature in some other readers.
Response from Mark:
Hi Allen,
Can you add a visit issue ticket for this request?
I looked at the reader briefly and it does serve extents up to VisIt if they are available in the quadmesh objects it reads.
For single block, Silo's DBPutQuadmesh call will compute and store extents in the file for you.
For multi-block, the DBPutMultimesh call requires that you use the DBOPT_EXTENTS_SIZE and DBOPT_EXTENTS DBoptlist options to output extents for each block. If you do not do this, there is no other way for VisIt to read them during PopulateMD. That is because the Silo plugin will NOT attempt to read each quadmesh block of a multi-block object solely to gather up extents information.

With our current CMake system, you cannot override the third-party values contained in the config-site files.When testing a new version of a third party library, I may not want to immediately udpate the config-site file, butwould prefer to edit the CMakeCache.txt file (for me, via cmake's gui on windows).
However, the config-site file is re-read upon every 'configure' invocation, and the VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT macroFORCES the value.
I think Mark added a way to override the config-site setting using command-line options.  This should beextended to editing the CMakeCache file directly, or via use of ccmake and cmake-gui.
Perhaps we could not re-read the config-site file unless it has been updated since last read?

I had a user report getting NaNs from the curl operator. When I looked at it in detail I found that the gradient calculation was creating the NaNs. It would calculate the minimum x, y, and z width of all the neighboring cells and use that in the gradient calculation. This caused a divide by zero if any of the neighboring cells had a width in the x, y or z direction of 0. A test should be added to check for zero. The appropriate lines are lines 487 - 498 in avt/Expressions/General/avtGradientExpression.C. I looked at this code and it is quite funky. This should be looked at.

Streamlines - Single seed point can create multiple IC. If you have a mult-domain data set and a seed point hits a boundary during the avtPICSFilter::CreateIntegralCurvesFromSeeds function it will report the seed is in mult-domains and create an IC object for each domain touched. This causes no problem in the code, we just use more memory and cpu, but will cause problems when doing any analysis with Streamlines or Pathlines because your number of starting seeds/ICs will be large then you entered. I think this will cause problems with multi-level data sets too. I have not test this.

I've written two good emails describing this problem, so I'll attach that here:
My response to the user:Hi Alex,
I believe your data is correct and VisIt is handling it wrong.
VisIt differentiates between different types of ghost data.  One type is ""ghost cell exterior to the problem"".  Another type is ""duplicated cell"" where the duplicated cell is ghost here, but real somewhere else.  For the former ghost type, faces between the real cell and the ghost cell should be rendered ... it's the exterior of the problem.  For the latter ghost type, faces between the real cell and the ghost cell should not be rendered ... it's a computational boundary, but doesn't represent anything real from the user's perspective.
The problem in this case is that VisIt's CHOMBO reader has too simplistic a test for marking ghost cells as ""exterior to the problem"".  That should be the designation for the cells along the missing octant (the concave portion of the boundary), but they are instead incorrectly getting the ""duplicated cell"" ghost designation.  The simplistic test only checks to see if a cell is outside the logical extents of the problem.  That works fine for non-concave boundaries, but, as you have seen, breaks for concave boundaries.
So: as you suspected, the issue is CHOMBO + VisIt + concave boundaries.
I filed a bug ticket and hope this gets addressed ASAP.  In the interim, I believe it may be worth experimenting with turning off ghost data at the exterior of the problem.  I think that may put the VisIt CHOMBO reader in a different processing mode.
Finally: I think part of what you want to know is whether you are generating a valid file and getting the simulation you want.  FWIW, I spent quite a while looking at the individual patches and I believe you are.
My description to Gunther:Each patch is a single cell and has 26 surrounding cells.  Some of these cells should be contributing a face to the exterior, but aren't.  My first suspicion was that we had a problem with our ghost nodes hack, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
Alex has ghost data on the exterior of the problem.  And we seem to be, for the most part, handling that gracefully.  The volume is a cube with an octant carved out.  Consider a cell that abuts that octant.  It has a neighbor cell that is in this missing octant.  That cell should have the designation ""ZONE_EXTERIOR_TO_PROBLEM"", but actually has the designation ""DUPLICATION_ZONE_INTERNAL_TO_PROBLEM"".
Looking at the logic in the CHOMBO reader, it has too simplistic of a test:                                    if (i>=lowProbI[level] && i<=hiProbI[level] &&                                            j>=lowProbJ[level] && j<=hiProbJ[level] &&                                            k>=lowProbK[level] && k<=hiProbK[level])
                                    {                                        ghostCells->InsertNextValue(ghostInternal);                                    }                                    else
                                    {                                        ghostCells->InsertNextValue(ghostExternal);                                    }
which does not account for concave domains.

The Export database functionality in VisIt just says ""Exported database"" when it writes out a file. It's usually not very obvious where the file was saved so you have to hunt around for it. It would be better if the message read: ""VisIt exported files to the /where/I/did/it directory on host"".

The Windows file system provides various shortcuts such as Computer, Desktop, Downloads, Libraries/Documents, Libraries/Pictures, etc. These map to various real folders under your home directory or elsewhere. I'd like to be able to browse to them easily within VisIt. I'm especially interestd in Desktop.
If I repeatedly click "".."" in the file open dialog, we have it coded to go up to ""My Computer"", which used to provide a list of drives attached to the computer. It doesn't seem to work on Windows 7, though it probably still works on XP. I guess I'd like it work again but do something a little different.
If I do "".."" from the C: drive then I'd like to get a list of folders that correspond to the various shortcuts I see in the Windows file explorer. See the attached image.

VisIt splits quads into 2 triangles by cutting across an arbitrary diagonal. This can lead to artifacts when doing pseudocolor plots. This is most noticeable when the data is symetric but because of this, the data looks non symetric. Triangulating the quads into 4 triangles with a node in the center fixes this problem. There is a way to do this, but it isn't easy for users to get at. It should be easy to get at and more obvious to users.

The attached file has a mesh with a single hex using arbitrary polyhedral zonelist. The hex comes out incorrectly though.The input file looks correct to me. All the face indices are ones compliment but that is ok because the nodes are listed such that right hand rule results in an inward normal. I am thinking that maybe the logic that assembles a hex's nodes from the arb. polyhedral zonelist is not taking into account the negation of faces that require a re-order of the nodes.

viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: The DB factory was told to open a file of type MemCom_1.0, but the engine had no plugin of that type.
so the mdserver sees my plugin and does it job, while the other processes do not see my plugin.
It appears that my plugins are compiled and installed in $HOME/.visit/2.3.0/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases whereas they used to be installed in $HOME/.visit/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases

my python line is:
db = OpenDatabase(""eiger:/project/csvis/jfavre/Vos/TransonicCruiser.db/data.1"", 0, ""MemCom_1.0"")
The only way I seem to resolve this is by manually copying the lib files from $HOME/.visit/2.3.0/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases to $HOME/users/jfavre/.visit/linux-x86_64/plugins
Is this intended, or do I have something out-of-sync?

This is a spinoff of #672.
I working on javascript to detect:(1) Windows, OSX, vs Linux(2) 32 vs 64-bit
I was expecting this to be most useful for the Windows & OSX users.
Detecting (1) is trivial, but I am not sure how well we can detect (2). The detection logic only reports the bitness of the browser app (not the os) & apparently even on Windows 7 64-bit, many people run 32-bit versions of IE.
For OSX & Linux, I think best way would be to create a ""visit_arch_detect.sh"" script that tells them exact architecture (using our launcher logic) & have the internal names shown on the web page  - this was suggested in the original ticket #672.

While using Contour Plot to visualize datasets, when manually selecting the colors in the 'Multiple' section in the 'Contour plot attributes' dialog, one also is forced to manually set all the individual opacities. This works fine when fine-tuning a visualization, but is rather cumbersome while trying to get a first, rough idea of the effect of changing opacities.
What I really would like to be able to do, is to switch on a checkbox that links all opacities, such that when I slide one of the colors, all the others change the same amount (note that I'm explicitly not saying that the other sliders should have the same value)
A more elaborate scheme would be to have a checkbox with each slider and link the sliders that are checked. In this case possibly an additional checkbox could be added that allows switching all slider-checkboxes, or maybe toggle them all (although I don't think the latter will be of much practical use)

I noticed this while debugging other things. When I open a db using -o command-line option, the mdserver logs show a call to CloseDatabase. It then immediately re-opens the same database. This is different from behavior if we opened the db from within the GUI.
I recall there being some issue for a while for Jeremy where -o on command-line would not work correctly. I am only suspecting a problem here. But a) I think the CloseDatabase may not be necessary and b) may be cause of problems Jeremy reported via -o switch.

1. Change Sphere to Sphere imposter-style rendering as in the Molecule plot. This lets you scale the sphere by a variable while still being fast and economical since 1 textured quad is used.
2. Add a new Sphere glyph made of polygons and rename the existing Sphere to SpherePoint or something like that.

We can shoehorn data into Silo by writing each of N related quadrature dofs (degrees of freedom) out using DBPutXxxvar. But, that creates problems downstream in viz. as each element can have its quadrature dofs oriented differently.

We're accessing an invalid element of some SIL stuff during initialization of the IndexSelect operator.  The issue is from this snippet of ::InitializeOperatorAtts:

   {        bool isOn = false;        if (silAtts->GetTopSetIsAllOn())           isOn = true;        else           isOn = (useSet[collection->GetSubset(i)] != 0);        if (isOn)

        {          subsetNameValid = true;          }
The issue is the line:
isOn = (useSet[collection->GetSubset(i)] != 0);
on my system, in the first iteration of the loop (when i==0), collection->GetSubset(i) returns 7.  The .size() of useSet is only two, however.  This causes us to access an invalid index, of course.
With debug iterators, this crashes.

Its use is conditional on:

So it appears that this logic is flawed. Looking back at e-mail threads regarding this change, it was Jeremy that introduced the use of MPI_Type_get_extent. He thought that it could be changed to always use MPI_get_extent. Some other discussion between Gunther and Tom Fogal on 4/10/2009 discussed making it confitional on MPI_VERSION.

Compile a C or Fortran simulation with libsim and gcc 4.4 or later and then run it and connect using VisIt. When you disconnect from the simulation, it will crash somewhere down in pthreads or libstdc++ when trying to create an exception. The code must be trying to create a LostConnectionException to propagate up the call stack.
Linking the C or Fortran simulation with C++ fixes the problem. Of course, we should not have to link with libstdc++ for these languages.
Maybe there's some extra exception handling in the runtime that we can do to prevent this behavior. Otherwise, maybe linking the runtime against stdc++ explicitly might help.

assert calls can lead to aborts. We have a lot of code in VisIts src dir tree (mainly in third_party_builtin) with asserts in it. Those can be compiled-out by defining -DNDEBUG during compilation. We should really be building a Release build of VisIt with -DNDEBUG defined in CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. However, I could not find any way to ensure CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE of Release would have this affect.

Steps to reproduce (either GUI or cli):- launch visit- change to some non-trivial Window-layout (eg 2x1)- change to any window that's not Window 1- Open some database- change to another window- Add a plot -> this will result in the error: 'Cannot create a plot until a database has been opened.'
The database that was opened does show up as the 'active source' in all windows. Also, when the database was opened through Window 1 and then a plot is made in any other window, there is no problem. It seems that Window 1 is somehow special in this regard, which is highly confusing.

The 'LaunchNowin()' function is not there. I think there are two possible ways to think about this:- it should not be there; just do AddArgument('-nowin') and then Launch(). In this case it is extremely confusing that after this call of Launch() the LaunchNowin() function in fact does appear in the namespace and that the LaunchNowin() version is also present in the documentation through help(Launch)- it should be there; nothing further to add - probably it is missing somewhere in the package description

Suppose we register a callback function for 'AddOperatorRPC' (assuming all other pieces of needed Python-code are there):
def visit_ao(arg1, arg2):

print arg1, arg2

RegisterCallback('AddOperatorRPC', visit_ao)
From the documentation I'd guess that the first argument is the index of the operator into OperatorPlugins() and the second argument is True when the operator is to be added to all plots and False otherwise. However the callback function always gets True when working from the GUI, irrespective of the setting in the GUI (haven't tested when calling AddOperator() from the Python-shell.... but that's kind of redundant anyway)
So either there is a bug in the code that creates this event, or there is some problem in the documentation for AddOperator() (well, to be honest, or on my assumption that the parameters that the callback function gets are exactly the parameters the function got that triggered the callback)

The online documentation is generated from the OpenOffice XML version of the User's Manual by a Python script called svn_bin/makehelp. Since the conversion to OpenOffice, the script generates tags in the resulting HTML that reference PNG images from the manual. We didn't used to do this since in the early days, image support within Qt was spotty. Now that image support is there, we do generate image tags. The problem is that we don't include the images in the release distribution since it would add 30Mb to the release. That's not such a big deal these days either so we should probably include them. However, putting the images into the src directory would slow our day to day checkouts.
I propose we run makehelp again to generate the lower-res images that we can include in the release. We can then create a tarball of them and check it into the docs/UserManual directory. Then we can change our ""make install"" to copy the images over into the release if the docs/UserManual directory exists as part of the checkout. We'll have to update the visit-dist script so it includes the images. This will inflate our source tarball.
Another avenue might be to put the images on the VisIt web site and change the Help window to try and download them if it can't find them locally.

Here is a report of some VTK build problems and the work around.
Hello,
After some fiddling I managed to successfully build VTK. For reference, let me list what I had to do: - in VTK/Rendering/vtkGraphicsFactory.cxx I had to uncomment the #if defined (VTK_USE_X) that surrounds  #include ""vtkXMesaRenderWindow.h""  - in VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx I had to add #include ""glx.h""  - then I run make CPATH=$PWD/MangleMesaInclude LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VISIT_PATH/python/2.6.4/linux-x86_64_gcc-4.5/lib (the latter was needed because the python-runtime library was not found during the generation of Python-wrappers - I'm trying to build using: ./build_visit2.3.0 --console --python-module --silo)
It is extremely important NOT to try to restart the build-process using the build-script, since that will run CMake, which will overwrite the changes just made. So run make && make install in the VTK soure-dir.
Now the build of VisIt itself aborted.... let's see what's happening there.
Greetings, Jakob

Below is a bug report on VisIt crashing when using the Query() function.


Hereby attached is a minimal script that reproduces the problem.
	
start the script
open some database
add a plot, have it drawn
Then hit the 'DoQuery'-button in the Tkinter-frame
The script crashes

Next comment out the for-loop that registers all VisIt callbacks (lines16/17) and rerun the above sequence. Now the unwanted abort of the script doesn't happen anymore.

Imagine a 2D surface in 3D space, like a height field, where the Z coordinate is some variable's value.But supposed this value -- and thus the Z coordinates -- starts at 0 in the first time step, and change afterward.For some file types, like WavefrontOBJ and maybe VTK as well, we guess dimensionality based on the Z coordinate.So when we open the first time step, we think it's a 2D spatial and 2D topological mesh.But if you make a plot with the first time step, it gives you a 2D window.At least for STxD formats, we guess dimensionality (and other things) from the 1st opened time steps.So when you change time steps, and you now have nonzero Z depth, but the window remains in 2D, and ""bad things"" happen (such as your geometry hitting clipping planes).
You can see this behavior in the attached file.  Note that ""re-open"" when on a later timestep (one with nonzero Z) fixes the problem for that session until you close the file, I think.
I can think of a few possible improvements, none of which are great:- WavefrontOBJ always report 3D spatial dim, but this doesn't fix any other formats like VTK assuming those show the same problem- always open all files in a group and take the max dim -- obviously a massive performance hit, and thus a bad idea- detect when we got nonzero Z coords in an otherwise-2D problem, and change the window state
This last one seems like it may be the best idea; I don't like that it gets the first timestep ""wrong"", but I can't come up with a good solution to that.

ok .. this looks like nitpicking :) but it might help other newbies and one only recognizes this the first time compiling a new software (afterwards you simply know what to do).

This looks like using visit-install has to be called this way:  svn_bin/visit-install 2_3_0 linux-x86_64 /home/itv/bin/visit because ""make package"" creates a file with the name ""visit2_3_0 . linux-x86_64 . tar . gz"" But visit-install has to be called like this:  svn_bin/visit-install 2.3.0 linux-x86_64 /home/itv/bin/visit or you will get errors after 50% of the installation process starting with this:./svn_bin/visit-install: line 606: cd:distribution/visit2_3_0.linux-x86_64/2_3_0: No such file or directory

I was wondering whether there is a way to determine what Queries you can do on a particular dataset, before actually performing that Query from the Python CLI. Suppose for example that there is some part of a script that performs a Query('MinMax') for some set of plots. This will fail when the plot happens to be a Mesh(plot). This will not abort the script, so it's not really a problem or anything.
Yet it would be nice to be able to do something like:query_list = AllowedQueries(some_variable)if 'MinMax' in query_list: >>> # do the Query

When making different, single plots active from the GUI, there is always one additional SetActivePlotsRPC generated with both the previous and new plot indices. See the attached script to make things more precise. Steps: - run the script - create at least two plots (optionally draw them) - use the mouse to change the active plots
Output when making the second plot active:SetActivePlotsRPC catched : (0L, 1L)SetActivePlotsRPC catched : (1L,)
Output when switching to the first plot:SetActivePlotsRPC catched : (0L, 1L)SetActivePlotsRPC catched : (0L,)
Output when activating both plots:SetActivePlotsRPC catched : (0L, 1L)
The first line that keeps appearing when activating just a single plot, should not be there I think. Of course the callback function for this event should be simple and quick. Nevertheless the superfluous calls to the callback function could slow down and worsen the responsiveness of scripts that make use of it.
I have confirmed the bug to be present both in version 2.2.2 and 2.3.0. Some machines at our institute still run 1.10.0. The bug doesn't seem to be present there, but I have to run over SSH there using X-forwarding.

I ran into a valid Silo file that VisIt can't read one of the multivars for. It considers the multivar invalid because it can't match the multivar to its corresponding multimesh.
Tracking the issue done, I discovered the logic for matching multivars to multimeshes in the Silo plugin is flawed. For each multimesh in the file, it cache's some information to facilitate matching to multivars. However, the information it caches is only the first non-empty block name. Now, if a cooresponding multivar has a different first non-empty block, the block names won't match up. To fix the logic, it would be necessary to cache all block names for each multi-mesh. Thats prohibitive at scale so we won't do it.
The right answer is for data producer to use DBOPT_MMESH_NAME option for all multivars. This option allows data producer to explicitly specify the mesh associated with a multivar.


I think the right thing to do here is
	
Educate all application code teams to start using DBOPT_MMESH_NAME option on all their multivars
Add warning logic and option to disable it to Silo plugin that will issue warnings when it encounters multi-vars without this option
After a period of time, remove the warning and the code to support matching

Just reporting a bug I'm encountering on Windows.  It's only an 
annoyance, but I've had several users in the company comment on it, so I 
need to pass it on.

The bug concerns the ""Lineout"" mode on windows.  When in lineout mode, 
the underlying plot isn't refreshed between when I click the mouse 
button to start the lineout, and when I release the button to end the 
lineout.  If I move the mouse around, I can generate a large white area 
with no plot.  As soon as I release the mouse button, the plot will 
redraw instantly (i.e. from video memory, not regenerated by VisIt) and 
the lineout will also appear properly.

Attached is an image of the graphic corruption.

Reported by Marc Durant.

I discovered this one accidentally because the embedded application was 
getting confused and applied the slice and clip operators to the same 
plot.  When this happens in a specific order, the engine crashes instead 
of creating the plot.

To reproduce the error:
1) Open a data file (For example purposes I used multi_rect3d.silo out 
of the data directory, although one can use any 3d data)
2) Add a 3d pseudocolor plot
3) Add a slice operator
4) Turn off ""project to 2d"" 
5) Add a clip operator
6) hit ""Draw"" 

On Windows, the engine_ser will crash - you'll get an error box that 
says that the engine exited abnormally and VisIt was unable to create 
the plot.

On Mac, the engine_ser will happily run forever without returning.  On 
my machine, it was consistently at 48% CPU utilization.

This is with the downloaded version of 2.3.0 on both platforms, but the 
bug is also present in VisIt trunk 14683.

I confirmed it crashes on linux too. If I reverse order of clip and slice, it works fine.

Hello,

It would be preferable if the Tecplot reader made no assumptions about
the meaning of ""x"", ""y"", and ""z"", and just use the first few variables
base on the user selecting the dimensionality of the data.  As far as
I understand, the units suffix has no meaning to Tecplot.

I'm very impressed with the quality of your software, and look forward
to the day I can ditch both Paraview and Tecplot entirely.

That sounds the simplest.  Some of my 2d files are recognized as 2d,
and some are recognized as 3d.  The ones recognized as 3d require me
to use the Project operator expressions of the form {ElectricField_x,
ElectricField_y, 0}.  The ones in 2d expect me to use expressions of
the form {ElectricField_x, ElectricField_y}.

It would be nice to be able to specify which variable is x, y, or z.
Then I can have a left-handed coordinate system by specifying y, x, z,
instead of x, y, z.  This is the trick I have to use in Tecplot in
order for the top of some of my devices to be at the top, and not the
bottom of the plot.

When files are grouped, PopulateDatabaseMetaData gets skipped for later time steps for readers that are not ""time varying"". This means that the setup step gets skipped and GetVar and GetMesh are called without prior initialization and they fail.

As a test case, I've done 2000 copies of simple CGNS file
(from cgnslib code examples). After that, I've tried to open the
database with these 2000 files in VisIt. Without success:
The metadata server running on host localhost has exited abnormally.
VisIt is trying to restart it.
Shortly thereafter, the following occured...
VisIt was unable to open
""/home/beaver/workspace/tmp-visit/cgns/grid_*.cgns database"".  Each
attempt to open it caused VisIt's metadata server to crash.  This can
occur when the file is corrupted, or when the underlying file format has
changed and VisIt's readers have not been updated yet, or when the
reader VisIt is using for your file format is not robust.  Please check
whether the file is corrupted and, if not, contact a VisIt developer.
However each cgns file separately can be plotted successfully.
If to decrease the amount of files in a database (for ex. 3 files),
VisIt would
be able to open that database and to plot the data from the first file.
But if
to shift the slider to the other cycle, this would cause the following
error
(I've plotted the mesh for ""Zone__1""):
The Mesh plot of variable ""Zone__1"" yielded no data.
The mesh for that file could be plotted after pressing the ""reopen"" button,
but each moving of the time slider causes the same problems again.

A user ran xml2cmake at LC and built a plugin. This ran xml2cmake 2.3.1 and that generated a CMakeLists.txt that wanted to install plugins to ~/.visit/2.3.1 instead of to ~/.visit/2.3.0, which is probably more appropriate. I followed the same steps but I edited the CMakeLists.txt so it would install to ~/.visit/2.3.0. My rationale for doing this is that patch releases are all binary compatible so I should be able to compile a new plugin against VisIt 2.3.x and have it work for all versions 2.3.x.
I ran visit 2.3.1 and it wanted to look for plugins in ~/.visit/2.3.1 instead of ~/.visit/2.3.0 which would be an installation place for any 2.3.x version plugin.
1. xml2cmake needs to set VISIT_PLUGIN_DIR such that it sets the patch version to 0.2. When internallauncher creates the directories used for possible plugin locations, it should also zero out the patch release for the version used for user-built private plugins.

I received a call from LC this morning stating that long-lived, apparently orphaned VisIt processes on login nodes are a constant problem. It sounds like the gui and engine_ser processes are often left after users quit. Apparently users are upset that this happens and LC wants a solution.
1. The gui problem would not happen if the users were policed into running client/server. As for a technical cause, I'm not really sure. It could be Qt-related. Maybe the gui is doing a waitpid() for another program to quit. Maybe it happens because a certain pool of users exits the code in some bad way -- like pulling the plug on their workstations.
We should look for the reason this happens and try and fix it. In addition, we should make the viewer print a message to the console when the display is not direct (at least for LLNL installs) that tells users how they should instead run client/server and tell how to do it.
2. The engine problem is confusing too. There is already a timeout limit that should cause the engine to die after an alarm timeout gets called. Yet, LC reports that engines run for days. Maybe the alarm timeouts are broken.

Hello,
After having some troubles to trace a LinoOut along a line defined from an isovalue, Jeremy Meredith suggests me to use a python script to solve my problem. The script can be found here: http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Creating_curves_from_contours
I think it could be useful to add a tool allowing to do so within VisIt. The idea I have in mind, is to add an operator that can create the a curve out of the different isosurfaces previously defined. If there are multiple isosurfaces the operator may create multiple curves as well.
The reference points used to calculate the distace could be highlighted by putting a dot or something like that on the isosurfaces.
Thank you,
Daniel

We almost have enough infrastructure to allow lineout along arbitrary curves.
E.g. take a 2D pseudocolor plot of var1, and add an isosurface operator using var2.  All we need to do then is ""unwrap"" or ""flatten"" that into a value-versus distance curve.
The code to stitch 2-point line segments into polylines occurs multiple places inside visit:- One is in the tube filter.  No help here.- Second is in the avtLineToPolyLine filter.  This gets used only in the contour plot, though.  As this user wants to plot one variable against another, he's probably using the Isosurface operator with the Pseudocolor plot, so this won't help.- Third version is in the save window routine for Curve data.  This almost works, as you can save a window with lines generated by the isosurface OPERATOR as a .curve file, however, you don't get the values of the second variable saved into a curve file.
You can save the window as a VTK file, though, and so I wrote a python script which would take a VTK file with a bunch of 2-segment polylines, stitch them together, and output the value of a scalar in the file vs. distance.  See: http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Creating_curves_from_contours for the details.
However, it would be great to have this inside visit.  I'm not sure the best way.  Options:- an operator which creates a new mesh which is applied after the lineout- a ""query"" which generates a curve (we can do this now, I think?)
Either way, I believe the avtLineToPolyLine filter is probably the right piece for the stitching, though we would probably also need to stitch across domains.  And then unwrapping is pretty easy.

This was reported by Hank Shay.
Using lineout tool, he took 3 lineouts very close to each other geometrically, close enough that you'd expect area under curve query from each lineout to be about the same. However, he repeatedly would get into situations where area under curve for one of the lineouts was off by 5x to 10x.
We exported the 3 lineouts to ultra. Low and behold, ultra said there were 4 curves, not three. One of the curves from VisIt was broken into two curves. There was a discontinuity in it when it was exported to ultra. However, as displayed in VisIt's viewer, no such discontinuity existed. The break appeared near a point where there may have been an artificial spike (see another ticket from Brad about spurious spikes in linout). When ultra did the integrals, the sum of the first two curve pieces was the value we'd expect.
When we exported the 3 lineouts to vtk, we got a .visit file with !NBLOCKS 3 and referred to the 3 .vtk files. When we re-read those VTK files back into VisIt (not curves now but 1d meshes), they plot fine but now also show the break (e.g. discontinuity) in one of the curves. And, when we compute area under each curve, we get correct numbers.
So, somewhere under the curves during the process of taking a lineout, a curve was discontinuous somehow. That discontinuity did not show up in the plotted curve but did show up when integrating. The integration query only considered one portion of the curves.
Hank says this behavior is new. He hasn't seen same in previous versions of VisIt and his been doing this kind of thing for months.

I have come across a peculiar behavior of the *Attributes-events for the plot-plugins in the Python CLI that I would refer to as a bug. At the very least it is confusing and annoying. Here are the steps to reproduce:- Create a very simple script, something like:import visitdef any_event(*args):>>print ""VisIt callback "" + args[-1]
events = ['PseudocolorAttributes', 'MeshAttributes'] # add any *Attributes you want for Plot-pluginsfor e in events:>>visit.RegisterCallback(e, any_event, e)
visit.OpenGUI()
Now create a plot of the type you registered, eg a Mesh-plot of some dataset. Now try to change the attributes through the GUI. Two things can happen: - you just change something - immediately an event is generated with the new set of attributes and the callback function is activated. However, the actual new set of Attributes is NOT applied to the plot.   In other words: the callback-function would have to do this. - hit 'Apply' - this will result in yet another *Attributes event, activating the callback function. But this time the set of Attributes IS applied. The callback-function doesn't have to do it again.
My problem is that inside the callback function it is impossible to find out which of the above cases caused the function to run (well..... maybe there is a way through some more global attributes - that would be a solution to this bug) Hence the callback function can't tell if there is a need to explicitly set the attributes it received. It is not a big issue, but it is quite different from the *Attributes from the Operator-plugins for which only events are generated upon clicking the 'Apply'-button. IMHO the latter is to be preferred.

In the Python CLI all *Attributes() functions corresponding to either plot- or operator-plugins get the standard name 'PluginNameAttributes()'. The Smooth-operator however appears as 'Smooth' in the list obtained from OperatorPlugins() while the *Attributes() function is named SmoothOperatorAttributes(). This breaks the above standard naming convention, which is quite irritating when looping over plugins.
The same problem appears for the corresponding callback-event. According to the OperatorPlugins()-list one should expect an 'SmoothAttributes'-event, but instead one gets a 'SmoothOperatorAttributes'-event.
I guess there are two ways to solve the issue: either rename the name of the plugin to 'SmoothOperator' or rename the corresponding Attributes-function and event to SmoothAttributes (which IMHO would be preferable, because that is more in line with the naming convention used for the other plugins)

Randy Settgast sent the following e-mail about turning off a specific error message.
Hello, when visualizing vector data, the first (initial) time step always gives a warning:  (The Vector plot of variable vectorname yielded no data). I assume that this is because the vector is of zero length at this point? If so, can that warning be turned off?
It would really be nice if we could selectively turn off error messages. If they all went through a single point a text comparison could possibly be done to determine if a message should be displayed.

Upon registering the 'PseudocolorAttributes' in the Python CLI I noticed that there are 2 of such events generated when just changing the 'invertColorMap' property. This is true both when changing this property through the VisIt GUI and when explicitly switching it through the Python CLI using visit.SetPlotOptions(). The ultimate effect is an infinite loop of these events when eg trying to synchronize these between windows.
Just to make sure it is clear what I mean, here is some script to reproduce:def pc(att):>>print ""PseudocolorAttributes""


visit.Launch()visit.RegisterCallback('PseudocolorAttributes', pc)
	
now open a database either through the script, or through the GUI after visit.OpenGUI()
and create a Pseudocolor plot

pa = visit.PseudocolorAttributes()pa.invertColorTable = not pa.invertColorTablevisit.SetPlotOptions(pa)

output:PseudocolorAttributesPseudocolorAttributes

Any other change (I have tested) will produce just (the expected) one event.

This was reported by Katie Lewis.
Overlink has an option to use absolute paths for various file operations. When this option is used, the multi-block/multi-file objects it creates in Silo have absolute paths for the filename parts of the block names. That means the file is not easily moved but Overlink indeed has tools to move it if need be. Nonetheless, VisIt at least ought to be able to visualize those files when they are indeed at the absolute paths specified. And, Katie tells me this is not working.
There is a small chance the problem could be in Silo library itself but I don't think so. Silo does attempt to perform some interpretation of file pathname parts of block object names to hand windows/linux slash swapping. So, its concievable that logic isn't handling absolute paths correctly and causing problems. However, more than likely, I think the problem is in the Silo plugin in VisIt where there is a lot of work going on to interpret the file pathname parts of block names.
I did not request data to re-produce because I think we can adjust out test clients to produce test data to tickle this bug.

Hi,
In a pseudocolor plot, when a data contain both positive and negative values, I would like to specify the color of value zero.  For example, I want to plot zero as white, positive values as blue, and negative values as red (with different shades of blue/red for varying values of the data).
One way to achieve this is to set data limit min/max such that min = -max.  Then use a color table that has a color gradient red-white-blue.  The drawback of this approach is that I have to manually set min/max.  I might not know these values before hand.
In pseudocolor plot's attributes, it would be nice to be able to automatically set the data limits such that min = -max.  For example, if the data is in range  -3.4 ... 5.2, then visit set the data limits as min = -5.2 and max = 5.2.  This would solve the problem mentioned above.
Here is one possible user interface.  I realize that it is more cluttered than before.  Someone might be able to come up with a simpler UI.
Min/Max:[ ] automatic[o] symmetric[ ] min [____] max [____]

I ran into this resolving #670.
When I ran all db tests, the Velodyne plugin was reporting a close failure indicating that it is leaving an object in the file open. I spent some time looking over the code but decided I didn't want to take time to find the problem and fix it. So, I am logging this ticket instead.
The reason I rated this higher likelihood and severity than you might ordinarily think (how often do any of us use Velodyne plugin) is that if Velodyne is enabled, then attempts to open HDF5 files will perhaps trigger a Velodyne attempt and Velodyne's failure to close prevent subsequent HDF5 plugins from being able to open.

The call to DBShowErrors() in CreateInterfaceReal() in the file ioperf_silo.c occurs before ProcessArgs_silo() is called, and ProcessArgs_silo() is where show_all_errors flag will be set.

A user reported that VisIt was crashing during lineout on rzzeus displaying back to his Mac. The failure is a little sporadic but can be reproduced doing the following:
1. Open noise.silo2. Create and draw a Pseudocolor plot of hgslice3. Do a lineout of hgslice4. Close the lineout window using the window decorations5. Do another lineout.
Repeat steps 4,5 until the viewer crashes. The crash is down in VTK's FTGL. Maybe the window trying to draw the text has not done a glMakeCurrent().
If I turn off all annotations and make that the default before I create any plots then I don't get a crash. Instead, none of my curve plots get drawn in window 2. Rendering is all screwed up at this point. This mirrors some of what we've seen with other reports of rendering getting hosed when displaying back from LC.
Since this is on the RC, we don't have a way for users to to client/server so we have a problem.
The trunk does this too.
Interestingly, I tried my VTK56WithMesa branch (using VTK 5.8) and it does not crash, even with text. Good.

This was discovered in helping Hank Shay with a related problem.
You can obtain data from LLNL SCF. Typical case is a 1D, wedge RZ mesh.
Do a filled boundary plot of materials. Try to use SIL controls to turn anything on and off. Nothing changes in the plot. I can turn off all materials and nothing changes. I can turn off the whole mesh and nothing changes. Applying revolve operator does not change outcome. However, if I export with revolve operator to a VTK database and then open that database (which will be a 2D circular mesh now), material selection works.
Next, I tried applying Box operator to this 1D plot. As I varied Box operator's Y-maximum, I could see that the plot's extents in Y varied as I'd expect. However, varying X or Z mins or maxs had no effect.
A Subset plot of the blocks mesh caused the engine to crash.

VisIt's PDB reader can decompose multi-component arrays into separate scalar arrays for arrays with shape (kmax,lmax,n). The decomposition does not happen right if the shape of the array is instead (n,kmax,lmax).

When I try to view CGNS data which includes boundary element geometry (boundary ""sections"" in CGNS terms) in VisIt with a pseudocolor plot, VisIt gives a warning that ""The compute engine running on host ... issued the following warning: In domain 0, your zonal variable ""Density"" has 10000 values, but it should have 12020.

The correct behavior would be to have no warning, as zonal variable data logically could be associated with only the internal cells, and not necessarily the boundary elements.  TecPlot does not have this issue and can plot these data sets correctly.
I have attached two files, both of a 2D data quadrilateral mesh data set: one contains the boundary face geometry, the other does not.  The one with boundary faces exhibits the problem described, the other works perfectly.

I use VisIt to read the Silo files with mrgtree, but there is a problem when read the silo files attached in this report.
If I read all three files together (file grouping = smart), the visualization of data0000.silo isOK but that of data0001.silo and data0002.silo are not correct. However, if I only opendata0001.silo or data0002.silo (file grouping = off), the visualization is no problem. The silo fils onlyinclude the meshes without variables in order to reduce the size of these files to mail.
Another question, I write my data into the format of ""vtu"" using the appended data and Visit cannot read the ""offset"" value correctly when the size of my data is larger than about 2GB. I guess that the variable Visit used to read the ""offset"" is int32 not int64. Am I right? (the ""offset"" in my data is int64)

This ticket contains usability improvements requested by a VisIt user:
When I double click on a curve plot, to bring up the ""Curve PlotAttributes"" window, it would be nice if that window had a ""log-scale"" for the domain and range. If I have zero or negative values, it would be nice to be able to set a min and max for the values, so the log is well defined (just like the pseudo-color plot attributes window).
Currently I have to bring up the ""View"" window to change to a log scale for a curve, and there is no way to set a minimum value on that same window.  I think it would be easier to use if the log/linear scale and min/max stuff were all on the ""curve plot attributes"" window.

Using save movie wizard, I wanted to create a template with two viewports, top and bottom in the viewing area.Several problems arose:
1) I chose a side-by-side layout which gives left-right viewports.  I attempted to change the viewport properties so that they would be top-bottom instead.  Values were not accepted until I pressed enter, and that moved me to the next screen.  I had to use the back button to go back and change the viewport properties for the second viewport, then hit enter again.
2) since #1 was such a hassle, I wanted to save my template. The default location for the template filename is VisIt's install directory.I didn't think overwriting this file was good, so attempted to choose a new location.  When I do, the 'open' button is greyed out, and I cannot do anything but cancel.
3) In the choose length window, First and Last frame were greyed out with ('set in template')  What does that mean? I didn't see any settings for first and last frames when I was creating the template.
4) I asked it for the command to run for a later time. When I did, VisIt issued this error message:

When setting hardware acceleration settings from the GUI, custom ""DISPLAY"" variable settings are not getting passed to subsequent engine launches.
The code for this is in common/proxy/RemoteProxyBase.C:

if(!launch->GetXDisplay().empty())
{
    AddArgument(""-display"");
    AddArgument(launch->GetXDisplay());
}

so it looks like GetXDisplay is returning an empty string even when the string is set in the GUI.  This probably means that changing it in the GUI is not properly setting the string in the first place.
Workaround is to just add it to the 'custom args' box we have.

Example files from Chris:
#--- Example file 1:import sys
_visit_path = ...some path...sys.path.insert(0, _visit_path)from visit import *
if Launch() == 0:   print ""Launch failed.""    sys.exit()else:   print ""Launched VisIt, version %s"" % Version()
Close()
#--- Example file 2import sys
_visit_path = ...some path...sys.path.insert(0, _visit_path)from visit import *
def main(argv=None):
if argv is None:       argv=sys.argv[1:]
if Launch()  0:       print ""Launch failed.""        sys.exit()
print dir()   print ""Version"" in dir() # This prints true, so why does the following call fail?
print ""Launched VisIt, version %s"" % Version()
Close()
if name""__main__"":   sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
#--- Example 3import sys
_visit_path = ...some path...sys.path.insert(0, _visit_path)from visit import *
if Launch() == 0:   print ""Launch failed.""    sys.exit()else:   print ""Launched VisIt, version %s"" % Version()
def main(argv=None):
if argv is None:       argv=sys.argv[1:]
print ""Version"" in dir() # This prints False, but the following call is ok.
print Version()
return 0
if name==""__main__"":   sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
First example works fine.
In the second example, the code '""Version"" in dir()', following the call to Launch, prints True, which indicates that the call to visit.Launch was successful and all the functions from the VisIt API are loaded (print dir() lists all the functions I expect from the VisIt API). However the call to Version() fails, with the error ""NameError: global name 'Version' is not defined"". The first example runs fine and prints the correct version number.
Third example: I have noticed that if I modify example 1 above to include a main function (like in example 2) calling dir() within this main function does not list any of the VisIt API functions. However, all the functions are available to me. Not sure if this clarifies the issue or not.
Chris got around the issue using the following code after a launch:

Loop through the local namespace and add the names that were just imported to the module namespaceloc = locals()for key in loc:    setattr(sys.modules[__name__], key, loc[key])

We should try to correct these cases.

Our exodus reader is using an old, hijacked vtk reader.
However, updating to use the native vtk reader will require changing how we build VTK:VTK_USE_EXODUS:BOOL=ONand VTK_USE_NETCDF:BOOL=ON
The reader is in vtkHybrid and the classes are not built unless those flags are on.
Not sure how much this change in vtk build will affect us.

I believe a bug has crept into volume rendering. When I volume render my data with 2.4.0, it is offset some from where it ought to be.  I know this by comparing it with a slice from the pseudocolor plot of the same dataset (and other data in the same file).  The volume rendering is down and to the left in the image.  The view normal is <1 1 0> here, and up is <0 0 1>.
Here is the same session file opened with version 2.3.2.  Here the volume rendering and slice are perfectly registered as expected:!!

It looks like the horizontal gui window mode is not behaving properly, scaling itself to an unreasonable vertical size. I don't think horizontal mode gets tried much. It looks like the plot list needs to be reparented into the splitter so it will use the space better in the horizontal layout. Maybe that would help to address the size problems.

Don Pellegrino reported to the users list that pick doesn't work with scatter plot.I found this to be true with noise.silo, Scatter plot of hardyglobal and shepardglobal.I debugged a bit.First, in ViewerQueryManager, there is some logic about whether to do a ""Glyph Pick"".  This logic is missing a clause for the Scatter plot.Second, in VisWindow.C, there is a method called GlyphPick.  It looks like it does a successful intersection, but it doesn't return a valid pick because it is missing some AVT arrays.I hit this code:                        debug5 << ""GlyphPick: Data does not have ""                                << ""avtOriginalCellsArray or avtOriginaNodesArray.""                                << endl;I believe that it did re-execute the pipeline to pull in those arrays.  I believe the failure is that the Scatter plot, which is creating a brand new data set from the old one, is not propagating the arrays along.So the second part of the problem is hopefully just to modify avtScatterFilter.C.

If you make a Volume plot and apply the box operator, the extents calculated for the opacity variable can be incorrect.This is because the extents for the color variable are passed to the avtVolumeRenderer ... but the opacity variable's extents are not passed.So the volume plot has to go and walk through the data to determine the extents.  The box contains only a subset of the data, meaning the range it calculates is only over that range.This creates a poor effect for users ... when they apply the Box operator, the opacities effectively change.
And this is not limited to the case where the opacity and scalar variable differ ... the opacity extents are changed even when they are the same.
The work around is to explicitly set the extents in the Volume plot attributes.

This is from Cyrus Harrison.
1) To use the nameschemeI found that I need to parse the namescheme expressions in order to get names & types of the external variable names. You already have the parsing code that handles these complex expressions. It seems like it would be nicer to take care of this in Silo? So each customer of the API doesn't have to write their own error prone parsing to pick up the array names and types. As an alternative, I supposed we could adopt a convention that provides these outside of the ns string, but that seems kludgely as well.
Ideal use case:
Calling:
DBnamescheme ns = DBMakenamescheme(DBfile *file, cptr);
Would fetch the silo vars that correspond the the external arrays and set everything up.Optional args could allow you  to set the root Silo path to the arrays & override arguments.
DBnamescheme ns = DBMakenamescheme(cptr,""."",evar1_override,...);DBnamescheme ns = DBMakenamescheme(cptr,""some/other/path/"",evar1_override,...);
What do you think? This would of course require a change to the Silo API.
2) I tried wrapping DBMakeNamescheme to accomplish something similar to this, but I ran into an issue with varargs.
I don't think there is a portable way to construct va_list outside of a varargs function - this is due to the fact that C varargs is mostly compiler magic.
So even armed with a list of external arrays, I have no way to correctly call DBMakeNamescheme.

This was requested by Jeff Keasler
Jeff would like VisIt to be able to operate in such a way that it can recognize a series of directories as a openable time series or even an individual directory as an openable file.
The use case is that he would like his code to write all parts of a multi-part file including the root file containing all the multiblock objects to its own directory.
The problem is that when the root files containing the multi-block objects are not all in the same directory, there is no way for VisIt to see them as a time series. However, this kind of storage structure is very convenient to Jeff because all the files, including the root for a given timestep stay in one directory. It can be easily moved around and shared with other users without having to remember it is a thing with two parts.
Jeff is willing to limit this use case to where both the encapsulating directory and the root file within that directory are identically named.
More from Jeff...
Couldn't the change can be completely isolated in the function MDServerConnection::ReadFileList()?
If (isDir(filename)) {   newFileName = filename + '/' + basename(filename) ;   if (fileExists(newFileName) && isStandardFile(newFileName)) {       filename = newFileName ;   }}
What am I missing?
Again, moving to this would not just simplify things for our team, but for every team.  Other teams could get rid of their hokey hacks and better encapsulate their data for their users if you tell them this is available.  Think of it this way -- in addition to simplifying file management, it could halve the number of items people have to stare at in their directories.
The extra check only occurs if the filetype is a directory, so the performance impact should be limited for the vast majority of users.

Finally submitting this bug. Summary: cycles are not always read/displayed correctly
ARS:I had several oddities with a series of silo files from a fusion app scientist at MIT, Linda Sugiyama. All of the time slice files are in individual silo files.
ARS:Case 1: Try harder is off,  file info shows first time but the cycles are present,
MM: I think thats correct behavior if your filenames have cycle numbers inthem. It can 'guess' cycles from the filenames. But, it gets only thecurrently open file's time correct 'cause it actually reads that fromthe file.
Case 2: Try harder is on,  file info shows all the times but the cycles are all zero.
MM:Sounds like incorrect behavior if the filenames have cycle numbers inthem. Should get all cycles and all times.
ARS: The other part is that when we did a plot using TimeLoopFilter (viaLineSampler) we found that all the times were correct except for thecurrent time slice, we tried the same using the cycles for axis andfound the same the cycle of the current time slice was wrong. Only thetime slice always correct.
MM:In this case, it is going to open all the files, right? Whenever itopens a file, it can at least get correct time/cycle for that file'cause its not any real additional cost to go read it.
From Linda Sugiyama:
Regarding cycle/time series cases 1 and 2:
The 'current time' existed because an initial, separate window was openedwith this time and was still displaying data from it,while the time series was being done.(It appears to be necessary to open one file and plot some data initiallyin order to for VisIt to be able to access the file series --true, or avoidable?).
The 'time' series list used the cycle numbers from the file namesfor all except the 'current' file.  There it used the actual time.It should use a consistent choice.
In Case 1, an additional bug is thatthe cycle number of the 'current' file is always set to zero in the cyclelisting. The position of the file in both time and cycle lists iscorrect, based on the cycle number in the file name,but now the cycle list has a zero-number cycle out of sequence.(In fact, there are two files with cycle number zero, since the first time in the series has file/cycle number zero.)
Initially opening the first file of the series still gives an'out-of-sequence' error warning even though the numbers are consistent.This file had file/cycle number zero and its actual time (note t>0) was much smaller than the cycle-number increment between consecutive files, so nominally both time and cycle lists are OK.  Allen's time-series operator makes an acceptable 'time' plot, even including the first file.(Not thoroughly tested - I think selecting 'Time series' works, but 'cycle number' puts negative cycle numbers on the X axis, centered around zero.)

The little check-box next to a profile name in the Launch Profiles tab of the Host profiles window I guess is intended to indicate which profile is the default. However, there really isn't anything in the window to suggest or explicitly say that.

There is a separate 'Make Default' button which actually does the work of turning on and off the check box. So, you can't just click in a box to check-off which profile you want default. You have to make a profile active and then hit the make default button. The whole interface regarding default launch profile is just a bit confusing.

However, the way I have it set up, I can only one system type (i386 or x64/amd) at a time, as I look for the link library in the ${VISITLOC\libsim\V2\lib directory.

The visit -movie command provides a -sessionfile argument that lets you set up the visualization that you'll use to make a movie. Users would like to use the session file as a template for other data files. However, in order to do this, the script will need an additional argument that lets users pass the names of new data files. If that argument is given then we'll use RestoreSessionWithSources instead of RestoreSession.

The dominant_mat expression is supposed to return the material number for the material that has the highest volume fraction in a cell. There is some code that sets up the possible return values by calling atoi() on all of the material names. If you use string material names that don't have numbers, the most likely case these days, then the expression will return 0's for the material numbers since atoi() fails. I think this step is taking place because avtMaterial may do some reordering of the problem-sized material list to avoid having gaps in material number sequences. In any case, it seems like returning the material index is better than zero.
Bob Corey ran into this when he was trying to create an expression for his non-mixed material that would simply return the material id for each cell.

Brian McCandless mentioned this to me the other day so I'm adding a ticket. He created a directory with a few Ale3D runs in it and the directory ended up with about 60K files. This is generally a bad idea. When he tried accessing the files with VisIt, VisIt tried to read the directory and get the file list, as it always does. Even with automatic file grouping, which should speed this up, it was really slow.
Perhaps there are some additional optimizations that can be used to speed this type of operation up further.

The Label plot is set to show a maximum length of 36 for labels, by default. That limit gets adjusted depending on the type of variable being plotted. Unfortunately, the code that adjusts the max string length sets the string length to 13 * the number of components, leading to a lower than desired max string length. The hard-coded 13 should be upped to accommodate higher precision format strings (1.16e). Replace the 13 with at least 25.
This issue will be more relevant when VisIt supports double precision all the way through the pipeline.

Al reported some bugs displaying multiple plots with history variables. Here is information about reproducing them:
The data files to reproduce the bug are:
if7f_001.00020if7f_004.00020
Bug 1:
Step to demonstrate bug:
1) Have ""Apply subset selections to all plots"" on (the default).2) Open if7f_004.000203) Add a Pseudocolor of hist/incmat1_1/dmfdt/temp4) Add a Pseudocolor of hist/incmat2_2/dmfdt/temp5) Press Draw
The second plot will generate the message:
WARNING: The Pseudocolor plot of variable ""hist/incmat2_2/dmfdt/temp"" yieldedno data.
This is because VisIt used the SIL selection from plot 1 of
incmat1_1 onincmat2_2 offincmat3_3 off
for plot 2, when the second variable is defined on incmat2_2. The work around is to turn off ""Apply subset selections to all plots"" and set the SIL for the second plot to be
incmat1_1 offincmat2_2 onincmat3_3 off
Bug 2:
1) Have ""Apply subset selections to all plots"" on (the default).2) Open if7f_004.000203) Add a Filled Boundary plot of material.4) Add a Pseudocolor of hist/incmat1_1/dmfdt/temp5) Press Draw
This gives a plot where the Pseudocolor plot is drawing extra partial zones. This is because it selects all the materials for the Pseudocolor plot when the variable is only defined on incmat1_1. You may need to hide the Filled Boundary plot to see the problem.

Simulations often have several different MPI communicators. VisIt creates a duplicate of MPI_COMM_WORLD and uses that in all of its communication operations. Libsim users would like to be able to tell VisIt to use a specific communicator. This means extending libsim but it is not clear whether there are broader implications for VisIt's use of MPI.
For example, rank 0 in the global communicator is the only processor ever connected to the viewer. Suppose the libsim user passes a communicator to VisIt that does not include rank 0, there could be issues talking to the viewer.

Marc Durant reported this...
I'm having consistent problems doing cmfe's with expressions.
I have two data files, one contains a mesh ""poly"" and the other contains both a scalar ""SumRhoJ_0"" and an expression ""Rho = SumRhoJ_0"".
If I do a cmfe of SumRhoJ_0 onto the poly mesh, it works.  If I do a cmfe of the expression named ""Rho"" onto the poly mesh, I get an error ""An invalid variable (Rho) was specified"".
Here's the expression that's being generated by VisIt:
pos_cmfe(</Users/mdurant/Documents/txcorp/VorpalComposer5.1/runs/crabcavpython/crabcavpython_SumRhoJ_1.h5:Rho>, poly, 0.000000)
And the active source when I make the plot is the datafile containing the mesh ""poly"".
Since I was getting the ""An invalid variable (Rho) was specified"" error, I tried switching the active database to the one containing ""Rho"", but then I get the error message ""An invalid variable (poly) was specified"".
I have attached a tarfile with data and session files that demonstrates the error.
Note that the problem appears to be specific to fact that expression for Rho comes from the database itself. If I define the same expression manually in the GUI, then the cmfe works.

978,Resolved,Bug,Normal, VCell database reader creates intermediate static libraries ,Brad Whitlock,-,2.5,Brad Whitlock,02/23/2012,,100%,,02/23/2012 12:48 pm,03/01/2012 08:22 pm,3 - Occasional,3 - Major Irritation,2.4.0,,,All,Any,"
The VCell reader is creating 3 intermediate static libraries and then linking them into the VCell plugin .so's. This is not allowed on newer Linux versions and it's surprising that we have not run into problems with it before. The reader should be changed so it includes the library sources into the plugin directly instead of creating static libraries that then get linked.
Here is a report of the problem from an external user:
Note that linking static libraries into shared libraries (aka partial linking, convenience libraries) is not supported by CMake, they would prefer that you use the source files directly, then CMake will figure out whether to compile them twice (with and without -fPIC).
This problem has shown up again in the VCellMTMD reader. The sources for the ""convenience libraries"" ExpressionParser, zip, and unzip should just be included directly to avoid
Linking CXX shared library ../../plugins/databases/libEVCellMTMDDatabase_par.so/usr/bin/ld: ../../lib/libExpressionParser.a(Expression.cpp.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `std::cout' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC../../lib/libExpressionParser.a: could not read symbols: Bad valuecollect2: ld returned 1 exit statusmake2: * [plugins/databases/libEVCellMTMDDatabase_par.so] Error 1make1: * [databases/VCellMTMD/CMakeFiles/EVCellMTMDDatabase_par.dir/all] Error 2
Also, why is it necessary to unconditionally bundle zip and unzip with this reader instead of being able to link a system version?

From Gunther:
I encountered a VisIt parallel engine hang on Hopper if the DISPLAY environment variable is set. I have resolved the immediate problem by unsetting this variable in internallauncher when running on Hopper. However, the hang occurs when the offscreen VTK tries to connect to the DISPLAY, which may point to a deeper VTK-related issue (since I would expect the offscreen version not to connect to the DIPSLAY at all.) I have discussed this issue with Tom Fogal (see below) and his comment is:
To whomever ends up looking at it: looks like the MesaExtMgr still has some X code in there.  We might want an OSMesaExtMgr subclass.  Or you can just remove the X code from the Mesa* classes altogether; we've broken all ""system"" + Mesa OpenGL use cases except for the system + OSMesa one anyway.  Feel free to ping me, I forget a lot of the details at present and it may come back to me if we start talking about it.
Further information:"" If DISPLAY is set and rendering annotations is turned on, the parallel engine on Hopper hangs in ""VisWinRendering::PostProcessScreenCapture()"" when calling ""renWin->Render()"". renWin is a ""vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow"" according to ""GetClassName()"".

DBAnnotateUcdmesh adds a shapetype array to a zonelist after reading in a ucdmesh in DBGetUcdmesh.The problem is that it keys off of ndims member to determine dimensionality of the entities and that member is the spatial dimension of the mesh not the topological dimension. So, I am pretty sure a writer creating a zonelist of polygons in 3-space will fail badly.

In DBPutZonelist and DBPutZonelist2, there is an ndims argument.
In DBPutPHZonelist, there is no such argument but maybe there should be or should have been.
At any rate, this argument is documented as the number of spatial dimensions in the cooresponding mesh. What? Why do we need to know about spatial dimensions when we're writing a zonelist? If anything, the most useful thing would be for it to be topological dimensions. On the other hand, other than the text in the Silo user's manual, I can't see anywhere where this numerical value is being interpreted except in DBAnnotateUcdmesh (and that method is really using as a topolgoical dimension anyways) and the Silo plugin in VisIt. And, I am convinced that it would be much better for this to be the topological dimension of the mesh.
If so, however, there maybe some example codes and data files that need to get updated. Anywhere we are dealing with a ucd mesh of topologically two dimensional shapes (tris, quads and polygons) in 3 space.

VisIt recently added support for connecting to remote computers through a gateway computer. When this option is used, VisIt can show the password window for the connection to the gateway computer but the window is not shown if a second password is needed to access the remote computer. On Linux, some users have reported that they can simply type their password into the console when a second password is required and have the connection work. Windows users are not able to do that so this enhancement primarily would benefit Windows users, though it would be good to support both.
The mechanisms for ssh password handling are different between Windows and Unix. On Windows, we add a password window to qtssh so any 2nd password handling will likely be enhancements to qtssh. On Unix, we use pty's to intercept the ssh password prompts so any modifications will go into VisIt's pty code and password window.

I noticed this in the 2.4 RC.  If you turn on keyframing, then as soon as you make a plot, the viewer crashes.  Or, alternatively, make a plot then turn on keyframing.
The culprit seems seems to be in QvisTimeQueryOptionsWidget::GetDatabaseNStates.  It appears to assume that if it got a time slider index, the time slider came from a database (correlation).  When you have the Keyframing time slider, this is a bad assumption and it asks the correlation list for a non-existent correlation.  I reverted this function to its old version (prior to Jan 2012) and the crash went away.
Two other notes: first, we're exploring adding other non-database time sliders (namely one for animation time), so any solution shouldn't assume we might have only one other time slider.  Second, I did not explore whether or not this bad assumption occurs other places, but someone more familiar with database correlations and time queries could probably eyeball that without much effort.

Randy Settgast has a large collection of ellipsoids to visualize. His data includes 3 coords for the centers, 3 radii for the 3 major axes plus 3 3D direction vectors.
To get him going, I took Brad's advice and suggested he use the tensor plot. So, he currently creates a point mesh for the ellipsoid centers and then creates a tensor variable on the point mesh such that the eigenvalues are his 3 radii and the eigenvectors are his 3 direction vectors.
So, there is a transformation from his native data to what he stores in the file and consequently browsing his data textually via Silo's browser or with pick/query returns the tensor form of the data and not his native data.
So, first issue is that We ought to handle his data natively so pick/query return what he's expecting.
Next, he also mentioned these other issues
1) Color the objects by a variable. I know that this will require a bit of work, as a variable is being used to generate the ellipsoid, and we want to use a different variable to color the object...2) variable resolution of the ellipsoid. It looks a little choppy right now

We recently switched at least some of the builds that we distribute for Linux on the VisIt web site so they do not use Mesa. This change was made so the Linux clients would be less likely to run into problems on versions of Linux that have a GL library based on Mesa. Unfortunately, these Mesa-less versions of VisIt for Linux cannot necessarily be used as the back-end server components of VisIt when VisIt is running client/server. It might work when there is an X-server on the client side.
The Windows VisIt client cannot not use the Mesa-less Linux VisIt as the back end. There is no X-server to speak of in the native Windows version so the remote engine has no X-server to use for its offscreen rendering so it crashes.

VTK should not need an X-server to do offscreen rendering
The engine should never set up vis-windows unless it will actually render. The current implementation sets up vis windows that are not used and causes the engine to crash when we execute a plot.

This problem cropped up in VisIt 2.4.2 when external users simply installed the precompiled binaries on their different computer systems and went to use them client/server to one another.

VisIt currently assigns different domains to MPI tasks. With increasing core counts and shrinking memory per core on the largest computers, VisIt will need to transition to a model where work will be distributed among a smaller number of MPI tasks and each task will have multiple threads to keep its cores occupied.
There are number of strategies that might work but in the end what we want is VisIt such that it can be built serial, with threads, with MPI, and MPI+threads.
MPI+threads will pay off the best for the large computers, while threaded-only VisIt might be something we can put out as binary distributions for computers that don't have MPI (multicore desktops).
There are some in situ concerns that might come into play. For example, we might want to be able to tell the contract when it can do threading.
This work will be performed by SDAV.

Richard Sharp sometimes enters the domain and zone numbers in the slice window backwards, which is completely wrong so the operator defaults it to (0, 0, 0), which causes it to do unnecessary work.

I dug in for a while and the values in the texture coordinates all seem to be relative to linear plotting, with the color table shifted to log form.  When we put in textures on the order of <0.005, then the values all get mapped to the color at the bottom of the color table.  I believe this is because the resolution of the color table is such that most of the colors are being lost.
This does not happen with the vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper ... if you apply a Clip operator and change the data from rectilinear to polydata, the problem goes away.Similarly, if you turn off 1D textures, the problem goes away as well.
(This popped up with a real AMR data set ... the contrived example above is just to get an easy reproducer.)

This was requested by Willy Moss.
He was correlating 3 dbs. Each has a different number of states and wildly different cycle indices but approx. similar time indices.
He choose to correlate in time because that results in best behavior but still not what he expects and I kinda agreed with him.
With a time-correlation, he still winds up hitting the 'next' VCR button 3 times to get all 3 dbs' windows' sync'd up to the next state. Thats because all 3 dbs are close but not at exactly the same times. Of course, this problem also worsens the more dbs in a correlation.
Brad explained that the way time correlations work is to take the union of all time indices from all databases and create a single series of time values that the slider and VCR buttons navigate.
Something Willy suggested was to instead have the option to pick one of the dbs' as the master for time indices (maybe the first one in the correlation). The time slider and VCR buttons would then navigate only this (sub) sequence of time values/indices and make the other's slave to that (e.g. pick the closest time state for all other dbs in the correlation).

Occasionally I get bit by the fact that stray .o's and .so's (especially plot/operator/database .so's) get left around from portions of the code that get obsoleted or whatever.
I did a trunk update last week and things built fine but viewer would crash on startup no matter what I did. I traced the problem back to some stray plugin .so's left around from early March before some VTK and Mesa libs got updated. Once I manually removed those, things worked.
The problem is that a 'make clean' can never remove .o's and .so's it no longer knows about and this can happen when a plugin or other source files gets removed or renamed.
So, I was thinking an additional make target might help such as 'plugin clean' or 'very clean' where 'plugin clean' means all plugin .so's are removed via some kind of find or .so operation as well as all the object files for the plugins and 'very clean' means something like ""find . -name .svn -prune -false -o \( -name "".[oa]"" -o -name ""*.so"" \) -exec rm -f {} \;""
I regard this as impact high because when you are bit by this, it can take a while to track down. On the other hand, you'd still have to know to use 'make veryclean' or something to fix it.

I was helping Tim Pierce install 2.4.2 on his windows 7 machine. We installed as single user and we selected all the LLNL host profiles, etc. and it all installed fine.
When we went to run it, Windows Firewall complained that it was somehow suspect of viewer.exe and asked whether traffic for that process should be allowed through the firewall. It gave us 3 options (domain, work or public). We tried to turn on all three but it required a system administrator's password and so we were stuck at that point. It would allow only the 'domain' option.
I was able to open and render data stored locally on the windows machine but unable to get client/server to LLNL's RZ or CZ machines working. I would get asked for a password but once I got passed that, VisIt would just hang waiting for MD to start.
I suspect the problem is that viewer.exe traffic was not making it through Windows Firewall and we had not recourse that did NOT require a system administrator to fix.

Even if closed both files, that instance of VisIt could never properly open the ALE3D files (He had to restart VisIt)Some HDF5 warnings were spewed to the command line.
I suspect the issue is Exodus (via NetCDF) being a bad actor with respect to the HDF5 driver.

When nodelist support for block-structured meshes was added to Silo plugin, it was done assuming a constraint that a given node's membership in various nodelists defined for the mesh needed to fit within a single integer value of a node-centered variable. This lead to two schemes implemented in the plugin and defined at compile time. One uses each node-centered value as a bit-map indicating a node's membership in one of at most 32 possible different nodelists. This bit-map scheme is extremely limited to at most 32 nodelists (# of bits in a single integer value'd node-centered field defined on the mesh). The other scheme, which is the default, is somewhat more flexible in that the number of nodelists it can support can be much larger. However, it still places a limit on the number of coincident nodelists any given single node can be a member of. Furthermore, the mapping is complex enough that it is difficult for persons writing Silo data to know well apriori if they may hit or avoid the maximum coincident nodelist membership limit or not.
Cyrus and Brad came up with a simple improvement. Instead of limiting the node-centered variable that gets painted onto the mesh to indicate each node's membership in each nodelist to a single integer valued array, why not define a general array variable of arbitrary length to support an arbitrary number of nodelists? The plugin can then return an array variable to generic database and then the boolean operations to widdle down the set of nodes defined by the current nodelist selection can be performed in generic database resulting a single 0/1 array that gets handed off to the VisItVtkEnumThreshold operator to finally cut up the mesh.

With nodelists as enumerated scalars, there is an ambiguity in the SIL controls window for what all on means. Does it mean the whole mesh (as it does for all domains on or all materials on) or does it mean simply display all nodelists but not the whole mesh?
This is not immediately obvious to a person writing code to output data to VisIt and so when they go to create a plot to see all of their nodelists, the don't get what they might expect. A simply solution is for them to create an additional nodelist that is all the nodelists combined.
But, this can be and probably should be automated by VisIt too.

The Mac version of VisIt cannot seem to launch the mdserver on localhost when attached to a VPN or WiFi network. It looks like the name that it looks up for ""localhost"" evaluates to something weird and our logic does not identify that network name as localhost. As a result, the viewer passes ""-host weird.name"" to the mdserver when launching it when it would be better to pass ""-host 127.0.0.1"" or ""-host localhost"".
These changes may result from a 2.4.2 checkin that added support for ssh tunnels through a gateway. Earlier versions of VisIt should be tested for this problem.

Stefan Kopecz reported that CNGS still crashes reading grouped files.  His use-case is 4000 files. I tried with 2000 files (duplicated sample data).

Adding FreeUpResources (which closes current open file handle) to the end of ReadTimes will solve the issue (at least as far as opening the files.)  It is unclear if this is needed elsewhere in the file.
I also noticed that the time slider had no times (of course, this may be due to my not having true timesteps, but simply copying a single file many times to create a virtual database).  The forward/back buttons worked to open the different files, but the time slider never moved.

Absolutely yes yes yes!  VisIt should open any file it knows about and do the right thing with it depending on its suffix.

Likely bug in how VisIt handles domain connectivity or ghost zone generation (Ares). The attached image shows that in one instance, VisIt makes plots without gaps where domains abut but the other picture shows gaps at the boundaries. Later experimentation by the user revealed that plotting the dataset in a fresh instance of VisIt caused the gaps to appear. When advancing the time slider, the gaps went away as though some crucial piece of information that VisIt needed to fill in the gaps was cached and available.
User e-mail:I am using visit to analyze some data in two different ways: 1) On my computer using the visit GUI and 2) on LC using the visit python interface. In the attached PDF (a screenshot) you can see the output from each way on the same data. The plot on the left was from the desktop with the GUI and the one on the right was from the python output. The problem is the lines cutting through the blue chunk in the python output version. And they are not just display artifacts, as they actually affect the results of a subsequent connected components query I run later. What would be causing this problem with the python version, and how can I fix it?
Cyrus:It is possible Ares isn't setting the proper Silo flag that tells us thefiles' metadata is time varying.
In VisIt's python cli you may want to try:  SetTreatAllDBsAsTimeVarying(1)
The data sets will still be helpful, b/c this may not be the only issue

I was doing some analysis in multiple windows and changing my pipeline several times and performing intermittent picks.

It looks like the Spreadsheet plot's attribute window is designed to populate the 'Subset name' combo box with only those (domain) sets that are actually selected in the current SIL. However, this is unreliable in the case that the currently selected subset name in the SS plot is turned off in the SIL. The combo box will still show the set and the spreadsheet itself will still show the data from the set.
I think its easiest to make the spreadsheet plot not try to be too smart and always display all possible (domain) sets. If one is selected that is currently off in the SIL, the table could go blank and/or show a message indicating the currently selected set for the SS plot is off in the SIL.

This was preventing a user from using client sever from Windows to the RZ  LLNL & it may be a common cause of ""cannot connect""  LLNL from windows.
When you first connect to a machine via ssh, it asks you if the identity of the machine is OK.You need to answer ""yes"" to complete the connection.
W/ our qtssh.exe - we can capture the password, but there is no way answer ""yes"".
This make seem like minor problem - connect once elsewhere (say using linux), type yes & you should be OK.
But due to how our host profiles are setup, I think it can trip up a large set of users, here is why:
The user had connected to rzzeus before, but our host profile uses ""rzzeus.llnl.gov"" as the host name - which requires another ""yes"".
After Brad & I figured this out, I told the user to use linux, to ssh to the rzgw & then ssh to ""rzzeus.llnl.gov"". He answered ""yes"" and w/ this response was stored. After this point everything worked fine on windows.


They reasons why this is tricky:
	
Users aren't likely to append the "".llnl.gov"", unless they know that resolves the issue. 
We (developers) aren't to see it b/c we already answered ""yes"" to most combos of hosts.

The RZ host profiles are geared towards desktop clients that want to access the RZ. As such, they turn on ssh tunneling and use rzgw as a gateway machine. This works fine for client/server.
When using the same host profiles on the RZ machines themselves, they break VisIt's ability to connect to simulations (libsim) that run on the RZ.
The simplest way to fix this would be to have the existing RZ host profiles be the ones that get installed on all clients and then have a separate set of RZ host profiles meant for running ON the RZ. The profiles for running ON the RZ would not use ssh tunneling or a gateway computer.
I edited the host profiles on the RZ for VisIt 2.4.2 so they do not use ssh tunneling or a gateway computer to fix this problem on May 22, 2012.
I verified that the RZ host profiles still work for client/server connections to simulations by connecting VisIt 2.4.2 on my Mac to a simulation running on rzalastor. So, client RZ host profiles should remain unchanged but profiles for running ON the RZ should not have the settings I mentioned.

Hi,
I'm having a few problems with the maximum resolution of images I can produce with Visit - currently 4096^2. I'd really like to be able to produce images up to the 16382^2 limit if possible. I'm currently using Visit 2.5.0, which I've built from source and otherwise runs perfectly, and I had the same problem with Visit 2.4.2, also built from source. I've built visit with parallel and python options, but no other extras beyond the defaults.
The mesa version I use is the default one from the build_visit script (Mesa-7.8.2).
I also have a version built from an executable on my computer (visit-2.4.0), which can produce images up to the 16382 maximum. Unfortunately , the data sets I use are really too big to be processed on a single processor, so I need to use the version built from source.
Thank you for any help in advance,

Jean Favre reported a memory leak that we suspect is due to automatic file grouping of several MTMD files.
========================================
I need some advice to understand what's causing a big memory leak I see.
I have my own parallel reader for a StructuredGrid. It adds ghostzones (just like the PFLOTRAN and other examples)
Most things work very well in parallel, isosurfaces, slicing, etc. I can animate thru long series of files without any leak.
the only one creating a leak is if I add a
AddPlot(""Subset"", ""curvemesh_257x768x448"", 1, 0)AddOperator(""IndexSelect"", 0)
to extract a small piece of grid (a solid wall). When I animate, it leaks and then crash.
So I have looked all day at my reader, but isosurfaces and slicing can be animated without leaking. The only one I found leaking is the combo of subset+indexSelect. Does that mean necessarily that the leak is there, or can it be elsewhere? Unfortunately, I have not been able to valgrind it. is it because it is parallel? Seems like valgrind is just ignored. Or else I messed up the setup? I have of course to launch with srun and then valgrind gets in the way. I am not sure how it all gets hooked up together.
========================================I get the following two regions leaking:
avtDatabasefactory.C (line 880) andavtMTMDFileFormatinterface.c (line 652)
so this is telling me my reader (or its parent class) is causing problems. The reader is Pixie (my own parallel version), and it is an MTMD thing. On top of that, I use the database grouping to animate timesteps stored in multiple files. Is this a well tested ground?  Is there some confusion because I group a time-series of a reader which itself supports multiple timesteps?
What other reader does that? is there an additional trick to make this go smoothly?-----------------Jean

An Ares user/developer in Texas using client/server from a Windows 7 computer to LLNL's RZ network reports that VisIt is really slow to send back results. He reports that the slowness happens with an AMR dataset. He also reports that a larger non-AMR dataset sends back results much faster. In the AMR case, the engine reports that about 4 minutes are needed to send the data to the viewer in Texas. The processing of the data on the RZ computer takes 1.3s. I replicated that timing so the network is the issue somehow. I've had the user try various rendering mode options (SR mode, image/geom compression, data compaction) and nothing helps.
========Hi Jacob,   I looked at your logs this morning and saw that it takes about 4 minutes to send data back from the engine to your Windows client. The time to read the data and process it is 1.36 seconds and nearly all time is spent writing the bytes over the network out to VisIt's viewer. I guess the time needed to do that could depend on a lot of factors, including your network speed and how much network is between the Lab and your local VisIt. How long does it take you to download 25Mb if you download from Windows to LLNL using scp?
Here is an excerpt from the engine000.timings file, which shows that nearly all time is spent sending bytes back to VisIt. The ""Executing network"" and ""Writing data to viewer"" parts are important.
Timing for    Executing network took 1.366193Timing for       Calling BalanceLoad in avtTermSrc::Update took 0.000001Timing for       Calling avtTermSrc::FetchData took 0.000002Timing for    Writing data to viewer took 246.095413
I'm not 100% sure of the plots or settings you're using but I did a Pseudocolor plot of ""den"" using the case8a00000.root file that you sent me. I ran VisIt 2.5.0 on a Windows computer, used default plot settings and had geometry sent back to the VisIt viewer so I could manipulate it. The time to process the data is comparable to what you observed. However, the timings show more information, including that 25Mb of data are sent back to the VisIt viewer. In my case, sending the data took 1.9 seconds.
I'm a little confused as to why VisIt gave me more information so it must be taking something of a different path through the code in your case than in mine. Maybe you're in scalable rendering mode. You might try moving your Documents/VisIt 2.5.0/guiconfig and config files out of the way temporarily to run VisIt with default settings.

Randall Hand wanted to save an PLY file with colors and it didn't do this by default.

the INSTALL target depends on the BUILD being up to date, and CMake thinks the python modules(visit_utils_py, pyside_hook, pyside_viewer etc,) are out-of-date, probably due to custom targetsbeing considered by CMake as 'always out-of-date'.
Should investigate if there is a setting that can change the custom target's 'out-of-date' status, or if we could disengage the INSTALL target from being dependent on the BUILD. (Though technically, it should depend on the BUILD being complete, so ...)

The Ale3D team maintains a test suite where they launch several VisIt cli's at the same time. They report that sometimes, VisIt does not start up successfully. The problem is likely due to having several VisIts that start at the same time.
Maybe the CLI log file?
The ALE3D test suite uses visit for some of the tests.Occasionally when running our tests suite we get a failure.I think it might have something to do with visit launching two jobs near the same time, although I'm not sure about that.  It appears that when we re-run a failed test, it then succeeds when running on its own.   I've created a simple script that demonstrates the problem (you might have to run it a few times to see).

There is logic in the CMakeLists.txt file for tools/DataManualExamples/Simulations to create a target (all_simulations) if VISIT_DATA_MANUAL_EXAMPLES is off.  This target is supposed to allow building the simulation examples despite the flag being off.On Windows, with visual studio, the all_simulations project is NOT part of the build, but all of the examples are, so they are built regardless. (I use Build Solution, not the ALL_BUILD target, I believe if the ALL_BUILD was used to build the solution, this may not happen).
I discovered this when I changed how PARALLEL settings are passed to the projects on windows:  the sim examples failed to build because I hadn't modified their CMakeLists.txt to account for the new PARALLEL handling.
Upon investigation, adding 'EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD 1' to the sim examples target properties will prevent the examples from being built using 'Build Solution', but also prevents them from being built by attempting to build the 'all_simulations' target.  When this flag is set, the examples can only be built one at a time.  Not an ideal situation.
A possible solution:in tools/DataManualExamples/CMakeLists.txt
IF(VISIT_DATA_MANUAL_EXAMPLES)
   # this is the current usage   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Simulations)ELSE
   # this will prevent the projects created in the Simulations directory from being added to the VisIt solution file.   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Simulations EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)ENDIF
in tools/DataManualExamples/Simulations/CMakeLists.txt

this command will create an 'AllSimulations' solution file that can be used to build the examples.PROJECT
probably want to remove the all_solutions project creation in this case

This proposal can be implemented so that it affects windows only.

On page 2-97 of the manual, it says for DB_ZONETYPE_POLYHEDRON that nodes should be enumerated over faces such that ""...are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion when viewed from the outside."" That is a right-hand-rule for an outward normal.
However, the example on page 2-98 does the reverse and enumerates nodes over faces such that right-hand-rule yields an inward normal.]
Which is correct? Well, Silo doesn't really care too much but VisIt does and so we need to see how VisIt has interpreted them and then correct the manual.
Note that DBPutPHZonelist does specify right-hand-rule yields an outward normal and the example also demonstrates that.I think what happened is that the example was written first and there was no verbiage in the manual regarding the node ordering except as could be deduced from the example. So, when I added explicit verbiage, I did so such that it was consistent with DBPutPHZonelist without looking at the example and got it wrong.

When I changed the VTK reader from a STSD file format to a STMD file format, it is no longer possible to group the files using the NBLOCKS method in a "".visit"" file. This is because it was never supported to group multiple STMD files using NBLOCKS. This is highly inconvenient and also breaks reading back VTK files that have been exported that contain multiple blocks, since the blocks are grouped with a "".visit"" file. A fix to that problem would be to export them to the appropriate parallel VTK file (although they don't allow mixing mesh types). The more general problem could be fixed in one of two ways.
1) Create an STSD reader for the single block vtk files and an STMD reader for multi block files.
2) Fix the problem of grouping STSD files. The relevant code is in SetupDatabase, which is in each of the STMD readers. Here is the one in the VTK reader:
avtDatabase *VTKCommonPluginInfo::SetupDatabase(const char *const *list,                                   int nList, int nBlock)
{    avtSTMDFileFormat *ffl = new avtSTMDFileFormat[nList];    for (int i = 0 ; i < nList ; i++)
    {        ffl[i] = new avtVTKFileFormat(list[i], readOptions);    }    avtSTMDFileFormatInterface *inter
           = new avtSTMDFileFormatInterface(ffl, nList);    return new avtGenericDatabase(inter);}
The signature of the routine would need to change, so this would have to be a change for 2.6.

A user reported this problem via email:
========
I've actually figured out what the problem was - if the InteractionMode option in 'ViewerWindow' is set to 'ZONEPICK' instead of 'NAVIGATE' in a session file then the python interface fails to load it. Obviously this translates to selecting the navigate option and not the zoom option in the gui window before saving a session file, so is quite easy to get around.
========
I'm having a few problems making movies of simulations using the -movie option in visit 2.5.0 (done using the 'tell me the command to run later' option in the gui). If the view is left with it's default options before the movie options are saved the movie script works correctly. However, if the view is zoomed in on a section of the plot prior to saving, the movie the script crashes out at the RestoreSession() line. I've experienced the same problem when trying to restore a session file using the visit python interface so I suspect this is to do with the restoring of session files with python and not the -movie script. As an added note, I'm able to restore the session files using the gui without any problems.

The Volume plot renderer will not show any output. There will only be an empty bounding box. If you turn off ""Sample data onto regular grid"" then the plot will appear.

Older versions of VisIt did not require setting of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. There was some code in the old C version of the front end module to load the visitmodule.so. Since the transition to a Python-based front end module, it is now necessary to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH prior to running python.

When importing VisIt into a Python interpreter, you can do the module import a couple different ways:
1. import visit2. from visit import *
Using the VisIt 2.5.x Python module, option 1 works but there are problems with option 2.
With option 2, the front end module functions seem to get added to the global namespace, which is what we want. However, the Launch() that is done internally to get the rest of the VisIt module to load dynamically still puts its functions into the ""visit"" module namespace. This means that the top level namespace does not get the rest of the VisIt functions.

When I create a plot of a CSG mesh and then change the mesh management settings, future plots generate cell mismatch errors between the mesh and material objects. I think the problem is that a new mesh is created with the new mesh management settings, but the old material object is gotten from the cache resulting in a mismatch in the number of cells between the mesh and material objects.
To recreate the problem do the following:
1) Open csg.silo2) Create a filled boundary plot of mat3) Bring up the mesh management window and change the discretization method from uniform to multi-pass4) Delete the filled boundary plot5) Add the filled boundary plot back
You now get the mismatch error.

1160,Developer Review,Bug,Normal, Volume renderer corruption after using SLIVR ,-,-,-,Cameron Christensen,08/09/2012,,0%,,08/09/2012 04:24 pm,09/26/2012 09:29 pm,5 - Always,2 - Minor Irritation,2.4.2,,,All,Any,"
The output of the other OpenGL volume renderers (Splatting and 3D Texture) gets corrupted after using SLIVR.
This bug was introduced sometime between versions 2.3.2 and 2.4.2.
SLIVR works on Linux for all these versions and a fix for OSX has been submitted to latest trunk. The corruption occurs on both platforms.
Reproduce: just create a volume render using SLIVR then change to Splatting or 3D Texturing.

Around version 2.3.2, the main render window stopped showing up in the dock or being accessible by CMD-tab (or CMD-` as an associated application window).
This is an annoyance for users with multiple windows open.
The ideal behavior would be for all VisIt application windows to be switchable using CMD-`, but even the old behavior of having the rendering windows show up separately in the dock (as if it were another application entirely) is preferable to the current state where it is only accessible by uncovering it and clicking on it directly.

If you use the Volume plot to color by one variable and do opacity by another, you won't get the desired picture for the splatting and 3d texture renderers. The raycasting renderer will produce the right picture.
1. Open noise.silo2. Make expression zc = coords(Mesh)[2]3. Make a Volume plot of zc4. Set the opacity variable to hardyglobal5. Select some low values and some high values in the transfer function6. Apply7. Draw
The resulting picture will use hardyglobal for the opacity variable as intended but it will also use it for the color variable. So instead of getting a rainbow of values in Z, you'll just get some blue or greenish values, indicating that the color variable came from hardyglobal.

Jean Favre reported this bug. Here is his e-mail reporting the bug and providing a fix.
hi there
I have a large binary tecplot file, a single 3D block with x,y,z coordinates which do not have ""standard"" names, and which I set explicitly via the ""set default open options"". The problem is that the 3rd dimension is completely ignored and File Information always reports that the file has spatial dimension = 2.
Debugging it points me to a single line which seems to be the culprit, since it returns the empty string for the call CoordinateVariable(2).
TecplotFile::CoordinateVariable(int axis) const { // stuff deleted return (axis < 2) ? vars[axis] : std::string(); }
I have modified this to be:
return (axis <= 2) ? vars[axis] : std::string();
and I can now successfully read the file as a 3D grid. I have looked at the tests and none seems to exercise the FileOpenOptions via a SetDefaultFileOpenOptions(""Tecplot"", opts), so it is possible this feature was undetected.
have others seen issues with that?
P.S. The file reads perfectly well with the tecplot application and with another open-source code.-----------------JeanCSCS

When you save a session using a single time state of data and then restore the session with a source that has multiple time states, the time slider does not get enabled for the new source.

6. Start VisIt again7. Restore session using sources with ""single_timestep.session"" 8. Pick ""wave*.silo database"" as the new source
When the session file gets restored, the picture looks okay but the time slider is grayed out. This indicates that the time slider is not getting created for the new time-varying source. If you reopen the file, the time slider gets created. When picking a time-varying file for the new source, we should get a time slider for it.

1199,Resolved,Bug,Normal, libsim ghost values are restricted incorrectly. ,Brad Whitlock,-,2.6,Brad Whitlock,09/21/2012,,0%,,09/21/2012 01:31 pm,10/15/2012 02:32 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,2.5.2,,,All,Any,"
To paraphrase: libsim ghost values have to be in the range 1-6 (or so) where they should be allowed to contain values that are powers of 2 that are or'd together to designate combinations of ghost zone states. Libsim needs to be changed to match what VisIt does internally. There's just an inconsistency at present.
A month ago I asked about issues with libSim and setRealIndicies for 3Dmeshes. Using this method for ghost cells, pseudocolor plots produce anempty bounding box (variable ... yielded no data) because the ghostcells are marked as interior by default and all the outer surfaces areghost cells. I've since attempted to use the newer setGhostNodescommand. For all possible combinations of blank, real, interior,exterior, etc, I get the same result as with setRealIndicies (VisIt2.5.2). It plots nothing unless I use the inverse ghost zone filter inwhich case it plots surfaces surrounding both the inside and outside ofthe ghost cell regions. I can also manually 'invert' by setting what Iexpect to be ghost as real and what should be real as blank, but thatdoesn't help me produce a plot showing the exterior of the 'real' cells.
I did produce the desired effect with pseudocolor plots in vtk outputfiles by setting the avtGhostZones variable to 16 (i.e. 1<<4 orZONE_EXTERIOR_TO_PROBLEM). Is it possible to set the avtGhostZones valuedirectly from within the libSim framework? In particular, the currentsetGhostCells command only takes integers 0-5 (visit complains that it'sinvalid outside that range) which does not allow for combinations offlags as the avtGhostZones variable does.
It also appears that the examples in ghostcells.c are all 2D meshes. Isthere an example of 3D (structured) meshes where exterior cells areblanked leaving only a valid internal computational domain visible withpsuedocolor? Any suggestions would be a big help. Thanks again.

This report comes from a post at the forum on visitusers.org:
I am using csg in visit to show the insertions and removals from a hashtable.
There seem to be a problem with the 3d plotting of a cylinder in Csg. I am using the dbcsg_cylinder_ppr  typeflag in silo (or at least trying to). The problem is that the plot's y-coords get assigned the value 0 (zero) no matter what I set them to. This does not happen for other shapes like spheres for instance. As a consequence one can only draw cylinders lying on y=0. Not what's needed.

Katie Lewis mentioned that it would be nice if 2d plots were put in 3d when combined with 3d plots. This should be done based on the mesh type, so cartesian should have z = 0, rz should have y = 0 and zr should have ???. I guess there could also be options on how to do it, so the user could override the behavior.

Right now it is fairly complicated to create a time history plot from a pick point. To the best of my knowledge, the user would do a pick, get the node, zone or coordinate from the pick output window, bring up the query window and select the pick query, enter the pick information, select query over time and then press the query button.
It would be nicer if the user just clicked on the point and it made the time history plot using some options. Perhaps from a right click pulldown menu.
Paul Amala suggested this.

Several users are running into the change that prevents us from grouping VTK files using a "".visit"" file.
I have tried to recommend the following pvtu grouping scheme:

It seems clear that .visit approach is much easier & cleaner. You don't have to say the type of grid in the file name for example, you can do both time grouping and domain grouping easily.

When I created version 2.0 of the Miranda reader and built it and installed it in my home directory, I expected it to overshadow the Miranda reader in /usr/gapps/visit, but because the old reader was version 1.0, both appeared in the lists.  The result was confusing because the version is not mentioned in error messages or other dialogs.  For example, in the Plugin manager, both are simply listed as ""Miranda"".  Some disambiguation would be helpful.

Ok, this may be a stretch for VisIt.
I just got done playing with NiCE (NEAMS Integrated Computational Environment) and one of the big features of NiCE is the ability to launch jobs on remote parallel compute resources. I think they put a lot of work into making that happen. But, I am guessing it doesn't handle all the variations and odd-ball compute resources and methods for job launching that VisIt handles. So, I was thinking VisIt's machinery could stand a chance of having a life of its own apart from VisIt and that products like NiCE could simply use the job launch capabilities of VisIt.

Our executable download page features large tables for many versions of VisIt. Can we streamline this so users are more likely to download the right version? One criticism we've often heard is that it is difficult to pick the right Linux binaries that are likely to work on a particular system.
PV's download page lets the user pick version, OS, and a couple of other properties and assembles menus on the fly so the user can download the right package.

We could do the same. Let the user pick a version. At that point the supported OS's for that version get displayed: Windows 32-bit, Windows 64-bit, Linux 32-bit, Linux 64-bit, MacOS X 32-bit, MacOS X 64-bit, (AIX for older VisIt versions)... For Linux, I'd add a dynamic element to the page that lets the user pick from Ubuntu, Redhat 5, etc. After choosing any of these, there is a list of file(s) to pick from and a Download button to get the selected file.

This will likely only work with LLNL-specific installs. In addition, due to an increase in number of color tables, it could require either that we prepend <toolname>_<colotable-name> to external tool's tables or that we opt for a more hierarchical view of the namespace of available colortables in VisIt's GUI widgets that interact with the list of color tables.

We need a solution for the long standing anisotropic rendering of nodal vars on quads.
This happens b/c quads are split into two triangles by OpenGL & the bi-linear interpolation we want isn't realized.
There have been a few attempts to resolve this:*Subdivide quads operator It doesn't avoid the fundamental splitting issue, and its defaults are targed a very large quads. This makes it very hard for users to try.*Splitting to four triangles  Still isn't high enough fidelity, for a symmetric dataset, can make everything look hashy.
I think the only solution is a shader strategy that splits quads into two tris, but provides all of the quad info so the proper interpolation can be done. This should be prototyped outside of VTK. Adding it to VTK is going to be quite difficult :-(.

Scott McKinely requested this...
We should add some ability to detect overlapping CSG regions. Not quite sure how to go about it but I think in the subdivision based algorithm we could use the fact that continued subdvision is failing to resolve to a single region.

Our # 1 way to find overlap is when we create a mesh and we double check all zones to see who owns a point. However, it is really hard to get a good scale down for this check. As an example, I am making a room that is 5 meters by 5 meters by 5 meters. However, the window is about 1 cm thick. So we would roughly need a mesh at the 1cm  level to find an overlap. However, I could easily see the problem in VisIt with the CSG format used. So adding this feature to VisIt would be wonderful since this is one of the biggest places where mistakes are made when setting up a Mobte Carlo input deck.

Fady Najjar reported a problem where the time slider in saved images was always showing ""Time=0"". I did some investigation and was able to determine that when VisIt is run in parallel, transparent plots cause the time value used by the time slider to always be zero. When there are no transparent plots, the time slider shows the right values.

A VisIt user was running client/server to LC's cab machine and was unable to connect. 2 things caused this:
1. Eric was testing 2.6.0 builds, which copied the new Python frontendlauncher to /usr/gapps/visit/bin/visit2. The user had ""use python-2.7.1"" in his dot files
When the new frontendlauncher is used against the python from 2.7.1 dotkit, the following happens (and VisIt won't run). When the python interpreter in question runs, it does not fail to load site.
Now that I think about it, this reminds me of something Gunther ran into. In the old PERL versions of the the launch scripts, we set PYTHONHOME. When we run the new frontendlauncher against the old PERL internallauncher, the PYTHONPATH would be set to VisIt's python. That version of python might cause an incompatibility with python 2.7, preventing the site module from opening. I ran into something like this during development, causing me to not set PYTHONPATH in the new launcher. I think Gunther's solution was to edit the old PERL internallauncher to not set the PYTHONPATH.

I tested this betweek skywalker and sidious here at LLNL.
I created a serial profile for sidious and specified a bogus -dir option so that it would fail trying to launch the engine.
The viewer process during the whole time of waiting for the engine to launch pegged the CPU at 100%.
We should probably do like we do in the engine polling activity loop...We start by polling as fast as we can and do so for a period of a few seconds. If nothing happens, then we insert nanosleeps to reduce polling activity a few orders of magnitude. It allows the engine to be maximally responsive as long as the user is triggering work but quickly falls back to very low activity when idle.

The crashes comes from running out of memory.  The problem is that the data selection is not sent up when requesting the secondary variable.  So the entire mesh is read in and that is too much memory.
Looking over the code, the action is in avtPickQuery::ApplyFilters.  It makes a new avtDataRequest which doesn't have the same data selection (for the slice operator).
I tried adding an avtPointSelection, but that also caused a crash ... it was using the point (X, Z, 0) instead of (X, 0, Z) since the Slice's transform wasn't being built into the pick attributes.  And I didn't see how to do an inverse transform.

The above VisIt command will fail because the internallauncher script still thinks that it is okay for the engine to be run using the loopback network interface. This is fine for 1 mxterm node. When you have 2 mxterm nodes as in this example, VisIt will report that the engine was unable to connect back to the viewer.
If you add -noloopback to the cli command line then the engine will be able to connect back.

For OSX 10.4, in build_visit we build Qt using Carbon, and VTK using Cocoa.Since they need to work together, this cases an issue. We should make sure to build them both with either Carbon, or Cocoa.
There are two possible paths:

Or rebuild VTK  with Carbon:---bv_support/bv_vtk.sh---     vopts=""${vopts} -DHDF5_LIBRARY=${h5lib}""      vopts=""${vopts} -DHDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${h5lib}""      vopts=""${vopts} -DHDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=${h5lib}""      vopts=""${vopts} -DHDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${h5hl}""      vopts=""${vopts} -DHDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=${h5hl}""      vopts=""${vopts} -D${VTK_PREFIX}_USE_CARBON:BOOL=ON""      vopts=""${vopts} -D${VTK_PREFIX}_USE_ANSI_STD_LIB:BOOL=ON""

When you launch the cli from the command line and specify a script with ""-s script_file"", the arguments after the script file name are for the script and need to come at the end of the line. Instead any arguments that are not known about by the internallauncher get put right after the script name and before the arguments intended for the script.

The code in avtLocateCellQuery has an incorrect assumption.  It assumes that the value of ""avtOriginalCellNumbers"" for a given cell is the index of that cell in the original data set.  So, if zone Z has ""avtOriginalCellNumbers"" value C, then it is assuming that zone Z was C'th entry in the vtkDataSet returned by the file format reader.  This property is true when we auto-generate the avtOriginalCellNumbers array, which is what happens 99% of the time.
The 1% comes because we allow file format readers to populate their own ""avtOriginalCellNumbers"".  For example, a reader may decide that the user wants the cell number for the first entry in the vtkDataSet to be reported as ""10"", not ""0"".  It doesn't happen often, but it could.
This becomes a problem with the logic in avtLocateCellQuery.  It overwrites the cell index with the avtOriginalCellNumber value:        if (canUseCells && origCells)
        {            int comp = origCells->GetNumberOfComponents() 1;            foundElement = (int) origCells>GetComponent(foundCell, comp);        }
It later uses foundElement as an index into the vtkDataSet, because it sets pickAtts.SetElementNumber with foundElement and then later sets ""pickedZone"" as pickAtts.GetElementNumber.        GetZoneCoords(ds, pickedZone);        success = RetrieveNodes(ds, pickedZone);
When we are retrieving values for secondary variable, this could lead to reading past the end of an array or reading the wrong data.
Again, the issue is with file format readers that set up their own array, since their values may not correspond to the index of the cell in the original vtkDataSet.

This comes up at scale with nameschemes. We can no longer really handle an arbitrary collection 'empty' blocks without employing some problem sized data structure to indicate which blocks are empty.
However, if we remove logic in silo library to explicitly exclude zero-sized meshes and variables (I don't think that logic is there for any useful purpose other than we just didn't think this was a good idea at the time -- I mean it certainly won't hurt a Silo file to have empty mesh and variable objects in it) and then ensure VisIt plugin will deal with these empty silo objects in the same way it no deals with the 'EMPTY' case in the multi-block object (it returns a NULL for GetMesh and GetVar format calls).

I was following the instructions for making a PySide-viewer client at http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=VisIt-tutorial-Advanced-PythonUI. When I run ""visit -cli -pysideviewer"", the CLI starts up as normal. When I source the Python file containing the UI coding, the viewer window changes so it contains 4 windows. This is nice.
When I run ""visit -cli -pysideviewer -s script.py"" where ""script.py"" contains the UI coding, bad things happen. It seems that the CLI does create the 4 panel viewer window. However, the viewer seems to be reverse launching another CLI with -newconsole or -xterm because another CLI comes up in a new terminal window. That CLI attempts to run the script (that has already been run) and it fails because it does not know what a QWidget is. It seems that running the second CLI is an error and I can't tell how it's happening.
Ultimately, I plan to wrap the visit command line in another shell script that I can run directly so I can deploy my app without VisIt-specific command line arguments, etc.

Cyrus has a reproducer.
The problem appears when there are mixed zones in a material region. Instead of the proper result garbage values appear (1e7, instead of ~10). These values stride though out the mesh - they aren't near the actual mixed cells.

I had a 2d plot and I was trying to take a lineout of it using a specific bit of Python coding and I found that I could crash the viewer. Note that I got the query text from command recording.

Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0, 0.16, 0), start_point=(0, 0, 0))

In the above query example, the start_point ends up being interpreted such that it appears to not fill in a doubleVector internally. When the viewer later goes to get ""start_point"", assuming that it is a doubleVector, the vector is length 0. An access to element 2 on the empty vector causes a seg fault.
ViewerQueryManager::StartLineQuery(const MapNode &queryParams)
{
    string qName = queryParams.GetEntry(""query_name"")->AsString();
    if (qName ==  ""Lineout"")
    {
        doubleVector pt1 = queryParams.GetEntry(""start_point"")->AsDoubleVector(); // THIS GIVES 0 ELEMENT VECTOR
        doubleVector pt2 = queryParams.GetEntry(""end_point"")->AsDoubleVector();
        ...
        else if ((win->GetWindowMode() == WINMODE_2D) &&
                 (pt1[2] != 0 || pt2[2] != 0)) // THIS SEG FAULTS!

There is no validation of the query input parameters here. Hopefully the validation is done somewhere though. It seems that a check to make sure each vector has 3+ elements would be needed. Also, figure out why the AsDoubleVector() is not working properly.
When I change the Python code to force doubles, the viewer works properly.

Query(""Lineout"", end_point=(0., 0.16, 0.), start_point=(0., 0., 0.))

Questions
The logging yields these results due to how the command is carried to the viewer as a QueryRPC.
For compactness and consistency ... 1) Should the Lineout version from the cli be deprecated and removed?OR2) should the logging be modified to present the ""Lineout"" form? OR3) leave well enough alone :)
Pick behaves as (2), special logic is added to  the logging to show 'Pick' instead of 'Query(""Pick"")'.If we choose (1) for Lineout, should the same be done for Pick?

This is from a user in the visitusers.org forum. He is trying to elevate some streamlines to look at them with some other geometry. It might be that once the surface is elevated that the streamline filters don't know how to handle it. In this case, it would probably make more sense to elevate the streamlines after they have been created. But that currently requires an export step.
Report:
========
I am working with a 2D depth-averaged flow model on a structured curvilinear grid in CGNS format.
The elevate transform seems to work just fine for scalar and 2D vector display but not for streamlines.
The streamline source is defined along a lineStart: [15400 4440 0]End: [15400 4630 0]
and works until I try to pair it with another plot using the Elevate by Variable transform with a scalar.
Once the elevate transform is enabled, the error I get is:The Streamline plot of variable ""VectorVelocityXY"" yielded no data.
If I check the ""Elevate with zero height"" option the streamlines are created, but are sitting down at a zero elevation (below the other elevated scalar dataset).
I've tried changing the z-coordinate of the start/end line to 1 or greater without success.
What is the preferred method to elevate a 2D streamline plot by a scalar variable so it can be paired with a 3D plot?

We have two basic routes to MPI support via CMake; either using MPI wrapper or by explicitly setting up all the flags for MPI includes, libs, etc. The wrapper approach in turn relies upon CMake's FindMPI module to set up the MPI variables. And.
Since VisIt is a C++ code, in all cases of the wrapper approach, the MPI C Plus Plus wrapper is (must be) specified. Otherwise, none of the C++ code would compile correctly. CMake's FindMPI module finds libmpichcxx.a to link to.
When we encounter a C code that uses MPI, like xdmf examples, we run into problems because we compile and link with a C compiler but link to a C++ implementation of MPI libraries without a -lstdc++ on the link line. This results in unresolved externals for C++ standard library functions like 'new' and 'delete', etc.
If we use the explicit approach to setting up MPI flags/libs, then I don't think we encounter this problem because we only ever link to a C implementation of MPI. Currently, we don't ever use MPI's C++ interface anywhere in VisIt.


Our options are to
	
eliminate the wrapper approach
get smarter about only linking to the C implementation of MPI even for a wrapper
allow for C++ and C variants of the MPI compiler.

Ray Tolar has fairly dense point data in a problem he is looking at and he wanted to do a line out. A reasonable solution would be to find all the points within a user specifiable distance from the line and then project those points to the line and then use that to generate the line out. This could in theory work with zonal and nodal data. With nodal data it would take the nodes within the distance of the line and with zones it would take the zone centers within the distance from the line.

Everything works fine when removing the symbolic links and adding /usr/local/visit/bin to the PATH.
Perhaps this is by design. I thought I would report to perhaps save others some time.

The intent here is to make some streamlines and sample additional fields onto them and export the data. The following steps produce an engine crash.
1. Open noise.silo2. Add a Streamline plot of grad3. Draw4. Open File->Export5. Set the filename to ""streamline"" and the format to VTK.6. Add hardyglobal as an additional variable to save7. Export

Reported by Andrew Young.
He recently got a new windows desktop. He says its a windows 7 system.
When he runs VisIt on rzzues and displays back (via X), everything starts up fine but when he tries to plot anything, it all vanishes and he gets an error message on the xterm where he launched VisIt indicating he should contact VisIt developers.
I asked him to run glxgears and it seemed to run fine though the gears did not actually appear to spin. I suspect frame rate was so high it was not possible to tell. When he ctrl-c'd, it wrote a message indicating frame rate was 57.2 frames per second.
He can run VisIt from rzzeus and display to another laptop he has. So, I don't think its his rzzues enviornment.
I've asked him to install VisIt on his windows 7 machine and see if he can run it locally there.
I've also attached viewer and engine debug logs from his session that failed to plot a mesh plot from globe.silo but I can't see anything suspect in them. They don't even indicate a bad exit situation. It feels like something way down in the low-level communication conduits between components.

A patch is applied. It splits LIBPATH and tries all parts in order, returning the first successful find of the visit python module. It applies to 2.5.0, but the change is so minor that it could be done by hand if need be (if it doesn't apply cleanly to the svn-version to which I don't have access).

Note that I indeed don't have DISPLAY set, as this is (intentionally) remotely, using ""ssh -x"". This is intentional because eventually this should run in the background without DISPLAY as well.
If I try the same with correct DISPLAY set this succeeds. Actually doing something however is very slow, as this is a slow, remote connection and visit seems to be using the local (local to me) DISPLAY for something.
What I would expect instead is that visit doesn't touch DISPLAY if -nowin is given. No window should be created (and none is, if DISPLAY is set). This would enable remote/background renderings.

When I run build_visit on Linux such that I have ""--qt --silo"" enabled, Silo's configure fails. This appears to be a flaw in the AX_HAVE_QT macro used in Silo's configure. I've run into this on newer Linux distros like Ubuntu 12 but it also happens at LC on rzmerl.

Hi,I have been using Visit 2.5.2 and 2.3.2 and they both worked fine on my Kubuntu 12.04 64-bit machine. Then some time ago I started getting the following:

The VisIt sceen appears for a short time but then it closes. Where do I look to find out why exactly it fails to start?The executables for both versions I have been using were downloaded from VisIt's website (Ubuntu 11.04, ubuntu1104-64.llnl.gov 2.6.38-8-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP, gcc 4.5.2), I did not compile them.

Reported by Allen Harvey Jr. Happens when using a python expr across multiple timesteps.
Action item: Create a test case to stress test python exprs over time.
When I create a plot and try to view my custom expression oruse it as a displacement, everything works as expected.  However, if Ianimate my dataset (I have say 400 Gadget Snapshot files), every timeVisIt advances 3 or 4 time steps, I get the error:

I am a bit surprised Qt doesn't handle this for us in its file dialog widgets out of the box. Maybe we need to turn on some Qt switches to make it happen.
But, Rich Cook reports that when he has a symlink to a directory...1) it does not appear in the list of directories (on the left hand side of file open/selected files dialog) and 2) when he tries to 'follow' the link by double clicking on it (in the right hand side list of files), VisIt reports an error that it cannot read the file.
It would be nice if VisIt could simply follow the link to the directory if it is a link to a dir.
I tested on Linux and get same behavior. So, I am not citing this as a Mac specific issue.

Here is the e-mail from Rich Cook.
I am getting a message, that says "" The compute engine running on host edge.llnl.gov issued the following warning: The plot(s) with id(s) = 0 yielded no data""
The GUI does not tell me which plot this is and I have several plots.  Is there a way for VisIt to tell me which plot is problematic by naming it?  I figured it out by fiddling with plots to make them come on and off, but this seems like a deficiency in the GUI.  Plot 0 was not the first plot in the list, by the way, so it really is a guessing game sometimes.

The variable ""airVfGradient"" is a vector variable. Nonetheless, VisIt plots it. It doesn't really give any explanation what its doing but it appears to internally compute vector magnitude and plot that. The legend's min/max seems to be consistent with magnitude. However, the plot itself is all gray.
Some options...

prevent CLI from creating a PC plot of a Vector variable and error out of the AddPlot operation with a message indicating you can't plot vector variables with PC plot, try using magnitude expression (maybe that is older behavior we decided to get away from)
issue a warning message that since it is a PC plot of a vector variable, we are plotting magnitude

Also, the actual plot's color needs to be fixed. Its all gray

He was doing an expression and getting garbage results and had no idea what was happening.
I am pretty sure he was hitting numerical overflow conditions but VisIt was never telling him about it.
Double precision through all of VisIt should alleviate this problem somewhat. But, I think we should add logic to catch (signals I think) overflow and underflow conditions and report them.

Lee Busby reported this.
Its easy to get this wrong but the order in which you specify the X,Y and Z sizes of a quadmesh or quadvar in the dims argument is not very clear. We should add verbiage to the documentation to make it clearer, maybe even with example.
From Lee...
I would appreciate your comments about the proper use of the
DBOPT_MAJORORDER option in Silo files.  I am attaching a short Fortran
program, with a couple of comment lines at the beginning.  You should
be able (rzzeus) to cut and paste those lines into a terminal and get
a picture in Visit within a few seconds.

The output file (foo.silo) contains a quadmesh, 6 nodes wide in X and 7
nodes tall in Y.  The coordinate values for the quadmesh are contained
in a pair of two-dimensional arrays x2 and y2, where any given node
(i,j) has coordinates (x2(i,j), y2(i,j)).  For this particular example,
x2(i,:)=i, for all j, and y2(:,j)=j, for all i.

There is a zone-centered field ""field1"", of extent 5X6, whose values
are just the integers 1-30.  Each of these objects appears (using the
Silo browser) to indeed be stored in column major order, with the first
dimension varying the fastest.

If you got Visit running on foo.silo, plot the MESH.  For me, that picture
is clearly wrong.  It mixes up the X and Y dimension.  Similarly for
""field1"".  Now go back to foo.f and change the majororder from DB_COLMAJOR
to DB_ROWMAJOR (comment out one or the other of the pair of parameters
at the beginning.)  Recompile, re-run a.out, and redisplay.  The ""row
major"" picture looks correct to me, even though the data in the file
is still apparently in column major.  A pseudo-color plot of ""field1"" 
is cold (blue) at the bottom left and hot (red) at the top right, with
the values increasing by 1 along the X-axis, as I would expect.

Do I misunderstand DBOPT_MAJORORDER?  I presume that it is an advisory
flag to the downstream Silo client (Visit, in this case), but that
setting it does not actually have any effect on the ordering of data in
the Silo file.  Is Visit just getting this wrong?  Do I misunderstand
what browser is telling me about the order of things in the file?  Or am
I just wrong in some other way all together?  This is very perplexing.

The BOV reader plugin under Linux cannot handle file offsets larger than 2GB. This is due to the use of fseek, which in turn uses only a long int (32 bit) for the offset. The solution is to use under Linux the functions fseeko or fseeko64, which use (depending on the comiler options) off64_t (or off_t), thus enabling large file support.
The fix consists in using the macro definition FSEEK and defining it to be fseeko64 for linux, see attached patch file.

Jean Favre mentioned memory issues doing volume rendering on his natively double-precision data.  Switching to single-precision helped his situation (he modified the Chombo reader). He asked if it should be a Reader option, which is probably a good idea.

This should be the easiest mode of the volume plot for users - but there are several frustrating road blocks.
First, the color map options for this mode of the volume plot are confusing See: #1367.
Second, we could be saved by the actual integration data file created, but VisIt can't read it without jumping though hoops. In addition to the text file, we should create a VTK rectilinear grid that is easily opened by VIsIt.
It would also be nice if we could integrate w/out sampling (like the XRay Image Query)

1)  Create categories (sub menus) for color tables. 2)  Easy categorization naming for private tables (eg kats/purple).3)  Allow user to 'delete' default color tables and not have VisIt load them.4)  Along with #3, allow user to reload all default color tables.

This is from a user who points out that VisIt's OpenFOAM reader does not work -- but PV's does work. He asks that we update our reader.
Dear VisIt support,There has been an OpenFOAM reader in VisIt since version 1.5.4 (year 2006), however this does not work with any present release of OpenFOAM.  To view OpenFOAM files, one has to convert them first to VTK files.  This may not seem like a big issue, but the additional post processing step can be both time and disk space intensive.
Is anyone at least aware that the OpenFOAM reader in VisIt does not work with the last five years of OpenFOAM releases?  If so, is anyone taking steps to write a new reader?  Please note that because of this one issue, I use Paraview instead of VisIt for my post-processing.
I look forward to your response.
Kind regards,William Case

When we write out all of our meshes and variables, we pass around a DBOptlist that has the dtime option set to the simulation time.
When we have only 1 mesh, we write the mesh to the root silo directory (and everything works fine).  When we have more than one mesh, we do not write anything to the root dir, instead we make directories: /region0/, /region1/ and write the meshes there.
In this case, visit does not get the correct simulation time.   As a work around, I wrote a variable named ""dtime"" in the root silo directory.  Now visit gets the correct simulation time.  It doesn't seem like I should have to do this work around, it seems like visit should know the simulation time.
This may be complicated by the fact that in one of our sub-directories, we have the variable MESHTV_SEARCHPATH set to an empty string """", to stop visit from searching below that directory.
The combination of this stuff seems to confuse visit.  Can you please fix this?

I use subset selection in VisIt to show and hide different parts in a VLD file (in parallel). Every time I save and restore the .session file, the selection is restored with everything on. In essence, subset selection is never properly restored under my usage when restoring a .session file. The only way to get around this is to make many of the same plot and use part id thresholding to select ranges of parts that I DO want to see. The session then restores the view properly because I am not using subset selection. However, this is a big PITA if I have a lot of unrelated parts in the model to turn off.

The internallauncher script adds ""-plugindir"", ""-visithome"", and ""-visitarchhome"" to the command line in, for example, JobSubmitter_mpirun (and others).  The engine knows what to do with these, but other binaries don't.  (Like visitconvert.)
This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, because visitconvert will ignore flags it doens't understand, so assuming the environment variables still work, visitconvert would be happy.
The real problem is that JobSubmitter_mpirun (and others) add these arguments before the other args, and visitconvert expects its first argument to be the input file name.  (I.e. it assumes options should go at the end of the command line, not the beginning.)
I don't know if there's any priority in making visitconvert (and other binaries) understand the -plugindir (and similar) flags, and I suspect we don't want to bother making visitconvert parse its input file differently.
This means the easiest solution is to either force those -plugindir (and similar) flags to the end of the command line, or simply to not add them if it's not the engine we're launching.
(I didn't try running 2.6.2 to see if any of this was fixed, but the important pieces of source code are the same as 2.6.1, so I assume it's still a problem.)

I think if you only have shades of gray in your plots VisIt starts dumping sRGB 256c PNGs.

When I try to do a vector plot in visit, but all the particles are in EXACTLY the same spot, I don't see anything for the vector plot.  This makes me guess that you are using the ""bounding box"" of the particle coordinates as some type of length scale for the vector lengths.
But this breaks down when the bounding box has size 0.  Can you please fix this to make sure the length scale is non-zero in this case, so that I can see the vector plot.  If the bounding box is 0, then just set the length scale to something like 1.  Then at least you can play with the scale factor to get something.

If you run VisIt 2.6.0 or later on the GNOME desktop on the LLNL iSRD network, the gui will crash on startup. I was able to look at a stack and I saw that the crash was in Qt's rendering of the GTK style. To avoid the GTK style, I added ""-style windows"" to the command line and then the gui came up fine and everything worked. Version 2.6.0 switched us to a new Qt and it is apparently not too happy with our version of GNOME. The crash does not happen on KDE desktops.
I edited the customlauncher for versions 2.6.{0,1,2} and made the scripts add ""-style windows"" to the command line so users would not run into the crash.
Inside the Customize() method, I added:
if self.generalArgs.exe_name == ""gui"":     self.generalArgs.arguments = self.generalArgs.arguments + [""-style"", ""windows""]
Bottom line: We should investigate why GTK style crashes on our GNOME desktops -- or failing that, make the customlauncher changes permanent for LLNL's closed customlauncher.

Cyrus' thoughts: I think we can do this with enumerated scalars, we just need to figure out the right conventions for CGNS.
Note from William Jones, NASA:
Typical CFD workflow involves dealing a lot with surfaces in conjunction with the volume or field data.  We want to access both the surfaces of the object of interest (wing, fuselage, flap, vertical tail, etc.) along flow features (streamlines, vortex cores, etc) in the same plot.
To facilitate this, many CFD file formats include boundary information along with the volumetric data.  For unstructured meshes, the boundary condition surfaces are typically exposed as collections of boundary cell faces (2D topology) along with the volume cells (3D topology) for each mesh.  These are not separate meshes as they reference the same points as the volume cells (points are a single list of coordinates and solution data).  They simply provide additional connectivity and are actually faces of the volume cells.  We rely on these to render and distinguish the most significant portions of the domain, the surface (again wing, fuselage, vertical tail, flap, etc).  However, we also may need to combine these plots with a volume plot (slices, streamlines around the geometry, etc).
How might this surface information best be conveyed to VisIt?  It would appear that subsets would accomplish this best.  Would one combine the 2D and 3D cells in a single mesh and assign different materials applied to the boundary collections so that they could be subsets?  Would the combination of 2D and 3D cells in a single mesh cause problems with VisIt (avtMeshMetaData defines a single topological dimension)?
As and example, the common practice for unstructured zones in CGNS is to define additional Elements_t nodes that define the boundary face cell collections and assign boundary conditions to them (sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 of the CGNS User's Guide 3.1.3).  I understand that these additional /sections/ are ignored by the VisIt CGNS plugin. Unfortunately, it makes use of CGNS files in VisIt quite difficult for practitioners who are used to the common CFD workflow.  I have looked at the source for this plugin, but do not think that I am experienced enough with VisIt to properly expose these additional entities.  Is it possible that someone more knowledgeable would have time to look at it?  Maybe materials are not the best way to subset.  I entertain all other suggestions.

I got this from Gunther, who forwarded it to me from one of his users. Apparently the installed Python is using a shared Python library, which means that frontendlauncher needs to be setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
We'll probably see this on various external Linux boxes.
======I just upgraded my computer to VisIt 2.6.2 only to discover that it refuses to run. Specifically, it complains
/opt/visit/bin/../current/linux-x86_64/bin/python: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.6.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
The problem is that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set to /opt/visit/current/linux-x86_64/lib inside the shell script. I can, of course, patch this manually, but it may be worth fixing upstream.

Fred Stecher sent 2 sets of 3 VTK files representing 2 time steps of a simulation. The first has a variable called ""hx"", the second has ""hy"" and the third has ""hz"". He wants to use cmfe to bring all fields onto the hx mesh so he can create a vector expression {hx, hy, hz}.
1. Open lens3d-hx-*.vtk database2. Open the ""Data level comparison"" wizard and place ""lens3d-hy-*.vtk database""'s hy variable on hx's mesh and call the variable cmfe_hy.3. Repeat step 2 for hz4. make an expression H = {hx, cmfe_hy, cmfe_hz}5. Try making a Pseudocolor plot of cmfe_hy.6. Draw
The engine will crash. Note that we have only attempted one mapping of hy onto hz here.
Other observations:1. The data do not look right on Windows when even plotting hx.2. There are a bunch of '\' escape characters in the created expressions. I don't know whether those pose a problem. I think they were put there to solve Windows path issues.

Ed Kokko could not make client/server work from his Win32 box in his office to RZ systems. It would ask for username/password and he would successfully authenticate and then it would just hang.
The problem turned out to be that Ed did not have passwordless ssh from rzgw to RZ systems working. When we enabled that, VisIt worked.
We were able to diagnos this using Brad's suggestion of trying the command 'qtssh.exe -l <username> rzgw.llnl.gov ssh rzmerl.lln.gov ls'
He was prompted for username/password twice but when using VisIt, a second prompt never appeared. That triggered our thinking that maybe what was missing was passwordless ssh from rzgw to RZ.
We spent a week exchanging emails and trying different things before we got to this point.

Willy Moss is doing some post process analysis that does not agree with the code output.

The Data Level Comparison wizard lacks the ability to create CMFE expressions that take time into account for the case when you have 2 databases (RunA, RunB) that you want to compare. When I map a field from RunB onto RunA's mesh, a sensible-looking CMFE expression gets created. However, when there are multiple timesteps in each database the expression does not behave as I would have expected.
The expression that gets created looks like this: runB_var = conn_cmfe(</path/to/RunB*.root database:var>, hydro_mesh)
I typically open RunA and then make a CMFE expression to map RunB's values onto RunA's mesh (the active source). Next, I made a new expression: diff_var = var - runB_var. When I plot diff_var, I get the expected values of zero across the mesh since RunA and RunB contain identical data. When I change the time slider, I get non-zero values and this is what I find confusing. With the above CMFE expression is RunB not supposed to get the same time slider value as that used for RunA?
When I change the expression to: conn_cmfe(</path/to/RunB*.root database0id:var>, hydro_mesh) then the right time step from RunB will be used and I get a difference of zero whenever I change the time slider for RunA.
I guess the bottom line is that I want the ability to set the time index behavior in the wizard for the 2 database CMFE expressions that I'm making. That would produce expressions that contained the [0]id (or whatever) time index values that I set. I had expected CMFE to behave this way by default and it did not.

This a catch all ticket for issues involving how compiler and linker flags are handled in build_visit.
Here is the email chain that spawned this ticket:
--Hi Everyone,I am doing some builds with icc and auditing build_visit for the proper behavior.(By this i mean actually using icc and passing the flags I selected.)
I discovered that --cflags & --cxxflags options add to C_OPT_FLAGS and CXX_OPT_FLAGS and I found this a bit odd. I expected them to be appended to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.
Looking futher, I found these (X_OPT...) aren't getting passed to some thirdparty libs.
I thought C_OPT_FLAGS and CXX_OPT_FLAGS were reserved for flags we wanted to use when --release was selected (note this should also be the default)
In an ideal world, bv_thirdparty.sh should only care about one set of flags from bv_main, to avoid omission of important options.It would be great to simplify things, but I think that is a larger surgery than I want to perform right now on build_visit.
Anyone have any opinions on this front?
-Cyrus
---Hi Cyrus,
My primary thoughts are:(1) I agree with the sentiment about having the number of variables bv_thirdparty.sh need to track be minimal.(2) I don't think you are obligated to conduct the larger surgery just because you uncovered the problem.
So, I think a good solution is simply collected consensus on what the ""right thing"" is (I think you got it, but others should speak up), and then submitting a ticket so we don't lose track of it.
Best,Hank---
Please update with any concerns / ideas so we can capture them for any potential refactor.

Users on Linux who have OpenMPI and build parallel VisIt will often get through most of a VisIt build and then the engine will fail to link because OpenMPI needs an additional C++ library.
There are a couple of ways this might be fixed:1. Use the mpicxx compiler to detect MPI in the generated config-site file.2. Define -DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX in the parallel CXXFLAGS so the MPI code will not need the C++ bindings.

I just built VisIt trunk using my system python and noticed that whileeverything else works, trying to start the CLI I get the messageRunning: cli2.7.0bImportError: No module named site
I was able to track the problem down to line 2236-2238 ininternallauncher which sets PYTHONHOME to the non-existent directory<visitlibdir>/pythonCommenting those lines makes the CLI work as expected.I am installing VisIt using 'make install' so apologies if that is notthe recommended way, however could that be fixed somehow?

The Python wrapper for libsim has some Python functions that allow libsim frontend functions to be called. The libsim functions used to be satisfied by linking the static libsimV2.a into it. Apparently, this was not a good practice and we changed over to linking against the shared library version of libsimV2dyn.so.
When you go to use the Python libsim now, you point Python to VisIt's lib directory so the module can be imported. Unfortunately, the module will not import because it references libsimV2dyn.so, which is in the libsim/V2/lib directory in installed versions of VisIt. A VisIt user ran into this and had to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH outside of Python, which isn't a very good solution.
Since the Python libsim module should be self-contained, it should probably just include the sources from the front end directly it its build so no shared library dependency is introduced.

Hi all,
Functions such as ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS() are getting called with parameters such as the one below
ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS(time_annotation ${VTK_DEFINITIONS})
where VTK_DEFINITIONS contains a list of compile time definitions (-D flags).
Unfortunately, it seems that by the time the function body of ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS executes only the first definition makes it to the body.
The definitions inside VTK_DEFINITIONS contain register overrides for VTK to dynamically load the appropriate subclasses. For example vtkRenderer is overridden to load vtkOpenGLRenderer.
Without these definition overrides the default vtkRenderer::New() operation returns NULL. This had the side affect of causing the VisIt viewer to crash when support for modules like R are added to VTK.
Needless to say this is really bad, and extremely difficult to diagnose.
Currently, I resolved this issue by passing ${VTK_DEFINITIONS} in quotes ""${VTK_DEFINITIONS}"", but I think we might need to find a better solution.
Also, it seems like we may need to ensure other functions or macros are not having similar truncation problems.

The iSRD Linux image was recently updated so I installed a binary that we made on the open network.

I was able to remove the ""-style windows"" hack from the customlauncher. I did notice that menus are not displaying icons. This affects the VisIt main menus, plot and operator menus, as well as in-window menus like the color table swatches in the Pseudocolor plot's color table widget.
The lack of icons might be due to the binary I installed. Alternatively, maybe the lack of icons was due to a global GNOME setting.

An external user reported that saved images of 2D Contour plots show a lot of gaps along contour lines when wide line styles are used.
1. Open noise.silo2. Add a Contour plot of hgslice3. Add a Resample operator4. Set the resampling X,Y values to 400x4005. Draw the plot6. Set the line width to 107. Save a 2000x2000 image
If you zoom in, you should be able to see various gaps in the rendered line. These gaps appear to be along cell boundaries.
I ran the user's script and dataset and the problem is much worse than what's observed with noise.silo. I ran with -dump and I can see that the line segments are being properly converted into polylines. We used to run into this problem more often when Contour was producing a large set of independent line segments because OpenGL's line rendering was not producing the desired output. When I added a filter to stitch line segments together into polylines, the problem was lessened.
I'm wondering now whether VTK is drawing the polylines as independent line segments.

I've been struggling with BG/Q login nodes setting the compiler to /usr/local/bin/bgxlc instead of the compiler that I specified: /usr/bin/gcc. I find that the compiler is set to what I want when I configure but as soon as the PROJECT command is executed in our CMakeLists.txt, the compilers get set to the wrong value. Furthermore, I find that this is ONLY the case with out of source builds.
I was trying to have a single src build with separate compute_node and login_node out-of-source builds.

I am running VisIt 2.6.2 under MacOs 10.8.3 on a MacBook Pro.
While double-clicking the VisIt.app bundle in finder opens the gui correctly, trying to launch VisIt via the terminal commands
open /Applications/VisIt.appopen -a VisIt
has no effect.
The reason is that my platform is incorrectly identified as darwin-i386,as revealed by
/Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/frontendlauncherVersion 2.6.2 of gui does not exist for the architecture darwin-i386.
This error message also appears, when trying to launch the command-line interface from within the gui, which makes this problem a bit more serious.
The culprit is found in the internallauncher script (lines 1860 and beyond) located in /Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/2.6.2/bin.
The script uses the output of uname -a to determine the architecture of the system. On my Macbook Pro, the output from uname -a is
Darwin ddm03588.empa.emp-eaw.ch 12.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 12.3.0: Sun Jan  6 22:37:10 PST 2013; root:xnu-2050.22.13~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 i386 MacBookPro10,1 Darwin
so the variable all_uname[-1] contains darwin instead of x86_64, leading the script to the assumption that my architecture only supports i386.
This problem may be solved by searching for x86_64 in the output of uname -a instead of assuming that it must be at the last position. For example using the string module:
#if all_uname[-1] == ""x86_64"":if string.find(self.uname(""-a""), 'x86_64') != -1:
P.S. I have not figured out, why this problem does not occur, when double-clicking the VisIt.app folder in the finder.

These issues were reported by Matthew Wheeler at AWE.
email:
======Id like to report a couple of VisIt issues that one of our users came across recently.
There appear to be two problems:Initially we were not sure if they were related  but we now suspect them to be different problems. (?)(The user was seeing both problems at the same time)
I have now managed to reproduce them in much simpler form with smaller and public domain datasets.(See notes further down). Hopefully these will help someone who understands that area better than me to pin it down.
1)       Visible white lines/breaks, randomly between some domains when using Parallel Software-Rendering.
User was running Client-Server, Software Rendering with a large 2D AMR dataset and trying to display a Pseudocolor Plot with a slightly transparent Mesh Plot superimposed. White lines appear between some domains as you zoom in and out but disappear if you switch to Hardware Rendering or force the problem to run on a single processor (-np 1). The resultant images can look very bad with a large complicated dataset. I have shown that the dataset does not have to be AMR  other 2D multi-domain datasets also seems to exhibit the same problem if you look carefully  but they dont always look as bad.
The problem seems similar to the reported VisIt Bug #1054  VisIt generates plots with gaps in between domainsAlso possibly similar to Bug #1350  although this seems to have a different cause (and has been fixed?).
I think I have now managed to reproduce the problem with a much simpler dataset so hopefully this may help in debugging - see later.
2)       AMR levels appearing coarser than the levels defined in the dataset, i.e. not all the finer levels being shown. Sometimes switching levels off and on again seems to help  but not always. Again switching to Non-Scalable Rendering (=Hardware Rendering) mode produces the correct result.Plotting the Mesh isnt necessary to reproduce this problem.See test datasets and example pictures.
We have tried experimenting with a whole bunch of factors .e.g.:Whether SR is on or off Before you start the Plot.Sometimes the first time you produce the Plot it is different to subsequent renderingsAdding extra Operators  doesnt seem to affect the problem.Re-Opening the dataset - ? - Not sure if this affects itOccurs in different versions of VisIt  discovered in 2.6.1 but seems to be present   in all the other versions that we still have installed  ~ 2.4.* - 2.7.0b- Difficult to see what the common factors are.
User has a short term workaround to use Hardware Rendering for both problems  but there must come a point when the datasets will become too large to display in this manner.
Test Datasets--------------------I have used two datasets to illustrate the problems  which you should be able to get at:
multi_curv2d.silo - illustrates problem 1, A 2D Curvilinear Mesh database  part of VisIt test suite (?) Consists of 5 domains/blocks in an arc.
amr2d_wmrgtree.silo - illustrates problems 1 and 2A 2D AMR dataset downloaded from https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo/examples.html(This is not actually as simple a dataset as it could be  Id be interested if you can find a more straightforward AMR dataset that we could both gain access to)
To Reproduce---------------------
Problem 1  Domain breaks:
In Parallel Software Rendering mode, running over multiple processors (np > 1)
Open multi_curv2d.silo (or amr2d_wmrgtree.silo)
Do a Pseudocolor Plot of an appropriate variable (say u or Density)
Add a Mesh PlotNow turn the Transparency of the Mesh lines down below 100% e.g. 16%
Observe the flickering white lines between domains as you zoom in and out.
Note that if you switch to Hardware Rendering (which would be the default for small datasets!) you would get quite a pleasing result  the Mesh would appear as a subtle hint superimposed on top of the colored surface.This must say something about where the problem is occurring  it would suggest that the data is being read-in and manipulated correctly  the problem would appear to be further down the rendering pipeline.
Problem 2 - Coarse AMR levels:
Just try to plot a Pseudocolor Plot of the AMR dataset while in Multi-Processor, Software Rendering mode.Note the chunky representation which is resolved when you switch to Hardware Rendering.
I am sending you some images illustrating the problems.They are in pairs with a good/OK (HW) and a BAD (SR) version but otherwise using the same setup
Let me know if I can provide more information or need to clarify anything.

When Rich added some specific boost requirements to this plugin, and we added logic to disable the plugin if a specific version of boost was not found, this plugin stopped being built on my development machines. At the time, I asked Rich if it mattered whether the plugin was available on our Windows distributions, and he said 'no'.
However, it has come to my attention that other developers, with the proper version of boost on their windows machines, may encounter build issues.  Since I am no longer testing the build, it's more likely to break as more changes are introduced..
So, should the plugin simply be disabled completely on Windows?

I'm building an engine-only build for rzuseq and it's building a bunch of ""_ser"" libraries too even though I won't need them. You see, on rzuseq, I install the engine-only parallel build into an install directory. I then install a login-node serial build into the same install directory, overwriting the engine_ser. I'd like for the compute node build to only build the parallel version of the engine in the first place. I'd like to specify this on the command line:
cmake -DVISIT_SERIAL:BOOL=OFF -DVISIT_PARALLEL:BOOL=ON -DVISIT_ENGINE_ONLY:BOOL=ON .

The build system will currently build all of the plugins that it can build based on the available 3rd party I/O libraries. It would be nice for the sake of static executable sizes and build times if we could pass a shorter list of the plugins that we actually want to build. This way, we could cherry pick the plugins that we want.
I'm thinking something along the lines of a variable that can be set inside of a config-site cmake file.
SET(VISIT_SELECTED_DATABASE_PLUGINSCurve2dSiloVTKXmdv)
The src/databases/CMakeLists.txt functions could check for a plugin belonging to the VISIT_SELECTED_DATABASE_PLUGINS variable before deciding to actually add it to the build. If the VISIT_SELECTED_DATABASE_PLUGINS variable is not set then the plugins get built normally.

Investigating #1414, using same data, (the tickets specifies a crash on Windows).  I found a different problem on linux
I created the cmfe_y expression using the Data Level Comparisons wizard as specified.It created this expression: cmfe_y = pos_cmfe(</home/biagas2/CustomerData/CMFE_VTK/lens3d-hy-*.vtk database:hy>, mesh, 0.000000)
Drawing PC plot of cmfe_y works fine. It's after saving settings (so I don't have to re-create the expression) and restarting VisIt that I run into problems.
Trying to use the saved expression to draw a PC plot I get this error:ERROR: Pseudocolor:  ()viewer: The file ""/home/biagas2/CustomerData/CMFE_VTK/lens3d-hy-*.vtk database"" does not exist.

The error occurs in the CheckPermissions call.   Interestingly enough, 'CheckPermissions' passes on Windows.  Windows fails later, trying to match '*.vtk database' with existing plugin's format patterns.

From Dan Laney:
Hi Eric,
I had a user come into my office wanting to transform a set of points in 3D to 2D.  I brought up the ""Project"" operator and the drop down box showed the following notation:
Z-Axis Cartesian (x <= x, y <= y)...
At first we interpreted '<=' as less than or equal and didn't understand it as mapping.  We eventually figured that out, but then became confused by how this notation was used in the cylindrical projections.
We discussed it and recommend / request, that the projections be described explicitly by the equations used in the projections, with primed values representing the newly projected coordinates.  For example, projecting XYZ to XY along the Z axis would have the following descriptor:
Z-Axis Cartesian (x' = x, y' = y)
This way a common mathematical notation is used, and it is quite explicit and self describing about what the projection operator will do.

We should maybe add something to VisIt to allow it to run in a non-caching mode. That is, to turn of database variable caching.
I can think of two contexts where this would be useful.
1. Is a class like an Ale3d class where users are re-running an app, generating same named data files and wanting to quickly look at them from within the same running VisIt session.2. Debugging a data generation app (like Ale3d) and the app is being re-run generating the same named files and the developer wants to quickly see the new data in the same files
Currently, the user has to jump through a lot of hoops to force VisIt to re-read the contents of files that may have changed out from underneath VisIt.
Adding a no-caching option would help elleviate that tedium.

The time slider is composed of the slider bar and the little slide button that you can drag left/right on the bar.
On platforms other than Mac, if you click on the slider bar anywhere to the right of the the slide button, the slide button moves one position to the right and the viewer window updates to that timestep. Likewise clicking to the left of the slide button.
On the Mac, two things are different. First instead of moving just one position, the slide button moves to wherever you clicked (actually I personally think that is better/correct behavior as most other sliders in VisIt I think behave this way). Worse, however, the viewer window will not update to the new time step.

If two databases are loaded when switching from the second back to the first it is not possible to create a plot. The viewer menus get updated with the correct variable list but under the hood VisIt retains the other database's variable list. Thus if the variable names are different between two databases those that are different are not accessible.
Open this file:
data/visit_dist_data/ucd3d.silo
Open this file:
data/visit_dist_data/multi_ucd3d.silo
Create a simple pseducolor plot of this variable: vec_magnitude
Now set the active source to
data/visit_dist_data/ucd3d.silo
Create a simple pseducolor plot of this variable: vel_magnitude
While the viewer menus are updated VisIt still seems to think the other database is active and gives:
An invalid variable (vel_magnitude) was specified.
So somewhere the database information is not being fully updated.

I've been digging into cmfe pipelines, and have discovered that ParsingExprList::GetRealVariable is called in situations where it may not be an exception if it doesn't return a real variable.  I was going to add a try-catch block around the call, but discovered that most of our code that calls this method doesn't attempt to catch the exception, either.
Should the exception be removed, or try-catch blocks added where the inability to return a real variable is truly an exception?
The situation I'm investigating where it may not be an exception is in avtDatabaseMetaData::MeshForVar, when processing a cmfe expression. The ParsingExprList holds expressions from the database being plotted, but we are attempting to determine the real variable of an expression from the donor database.  The expression is held in the avtDatabaseMetaData of the donor database.

1528,Rejected,Bug,Normal, Ability to build external plugins is broken ,-,-,-,Mark Miller,07/02/2013,,0%,,07/02/2013 02:14 pm,07/03/2013 02:11 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,2.6.2,,,All,Any,"
The ability to build a database plugin (probably other plugin types too) external to the source tree is broken and it looks like it has been broken ever since we re-organized our VTK installations such that a) we didn't have a symlink from the source tree to the vtk includes and libraries and b) all the vtk includes are in one dir and all the vtk libs are in another dir. Thats just one aspect of things that are broken though.
To build an external plugin, the plugin needs to be able to include header files from the VisIt source directory tree.
But, the PluginVsInstall.cmake file is in the directory where VisIt was built and when you set VISIT_SOURCE_DIR so that it can find that cmake file during an eventual compile, the compiler is then unable to find VisIt header files. We may need to add a VISIT_BUILD_DIR symbol to a plugin's CMakeList.txt file to resolve this.

Load the PluginVsInstall.cmake file from the VISIT_BUILD_DIR
but continue to use -I${VISIT_SRC_DIR} directives to the compiler

I have been able to get pretty far by making minor patches to PluginVsInstall.cmake.in and then invoking cmake like so...
cmake -DVISIT_SOURCE_DIR:PATH=/g/g11/miller86/visit/2.6RC_trunk/src -DVISIT_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/g/g11/miller86/visit/2.6RC_trunk/src -C CMakeSettings.txt .
where CMakeSettings.txt has a single line like so...

This came up as a host profile question on visit-users. A user wanted to add host profiles for NREL systems to our distrubitons.
Instead of that, I am thinking it would be good to just make it possible for users to import host-profiles, or for that matter an XML content we use (e.g. settings, color maps, etc.) from a URL.
That way, folks supporting VisIt at super-computing center X can publish and maintain their own host profiles and then just advise users on where to go to get them.
Yes, it might still be good if VisIt itself 'knows' the URLs for commonly used cases, too. But, its easy for us to maintain a list of URLs. Its harder if we also have to maintain the host profile files themselves.

visit -cli

ExportDatabase(e)

The silo file produced by the 2nd export has all the correct mesh and mesh-variables but the cycle/time information in the file is the same as the first timestep that was plotted. If first plot say timestep 20 and export that, you get the correct cycle/time for timestep 20. But, if you then change the time slider and attempt to export again, you still get cycle/time for timestep 20.

The custom plugin appears at the top of the list and not in alphabetical order.
Now, there may be good reason for putting the custom plugin at the top of the list to set it apart from the others.
Nonetheless, at least one user at INL got confused by this. He saw what he thought was a long list in alpha order and immediately scrolled down to the E's for 'Exodus' and couldn't find his custom Exodus plugin.
Just putting the plugin at the top of the list is not sufficient to set it apart from the otherwise alpha order one sees when opening this list. A different color background or font for the custom entries would help a lot more. Otherwise, perhaps not doing anything special might be better.

This line is part of the Expressions portion of the file. So, I suspect VisIt's escape character '\' is getting passed through to XML un-interpreted but that XML files require the use of a different escape character (maybe '&').

When attempting to build sample code using libsilo-dev shipped with Linux Mint(Ubuntu/Debiam) (v4.8-13) I had compilation issues because silo.inc is formatted as a hybrid F77/F9x fixed-format file. Specifically, F9x free-format expects a continuation character of '&' placed at the end of a line to be continued, rather than prepending a character in column 6 on the subsequent line(s). There are also issues with comment characters, case, and stringlength (see Bug #503).
I checked if this issue was still present in the current build and it is, though it's not apparent since no lines were wrapped duringmy testing.
Attached to Bug #503 is an updated version of mkinc which seems to address the above issues. The full summary of the changes are as follows:
Enhanced F77- and F9X-style output. Specifically:

Better estimate of C string length (fix for Bug #503). Leading    and trailing delimiters are ignored in length calculation as are   escaped entities (\n, \r, etc.)


Accepts command-line argument of --f90 to produce F9x-style output   compatible with both fixed- and free-format F9x code


Improved standards compliance. Changed comment and continuation    characters to be appropriate for both F77 and F9x. Note that    lower-case is an extension to F77 so F77 identifiers have been   upcased


Converted standalone EXTERNAL and PARAMETER statements to    attributes of type declarations for F9x. This is a F9x best   practice by putting all variable properties in one place    as attributes to the variable declaration.


Removed line-wrapping code; declarations have been burst into   one per line. This obviates the need for line wrapping and makes   differences in the exposed API clearer between versions.

It seems to work after cursory testing (visual inspection of output).
While it's technically more of a feature request, I'd suggest writing two separate include files, one for F77 and one for F9x. The modified mkinc writes F90 with a six space indent, continuation characters ('&') are appended to lines which are continued, and prepended in column 6 of subsequent lines, allowing the resulting file to work unmodified with both free- and fixed-format F9x code.
Again, I've attached the modified mkinc to a response to Bug #503 rather than duplicate it here. Please let me know if you have anycomments or questions.

1) VisIt color tables are limited to 200 colors, silently truncating to that number if I make a .ct file with more.That's OK, but the truncation is a serious misfeature -- obviously visit should interpolate my 256 colors (say) down to the maximum 200 it canhandle, rather than simply truncating the table and ignoring the final 56 colors entirely.

So I guess adding -lQtCore in the right place would fix that part of the problem.

If double-precision is forced for the pipeline, avtTransformManager converts species scalars from float to double, which causes problems in Species selection because avtMaterial and avtSpecies only work with float.
I think the transform manager should skip the conversion in this case.

Apps on the mac that have multiple windows have a 'Windows' menu and then display in the pull down for that menu all the currently open Windows for the app. You can then bring whatever of those windows you want to the front by selecting it. We don't do that on VisIt and so VisIt behaves in an odd-ball way relative to other Mac apps in this regard.
All aspects of VisIt's gui are grey'd out unless the GUI window itself is the 'front' one. Even if a viewer window is the Mac's active window and you can plan and zoom in the viewer window, the top menu bar shows whatever other app was used before making the viewer window the active one. That is very confusing.

If you bring up threshold operator atts and add variables to threshold by, then try selecting a variable to delete. You can't do it by selecting anything in the variable name column.

While adding the Precision type preference, I found that we don't have a consistent way for sharing such information with the engine.A lot of information (including preferences) is stored in the state object GlobalAttributes.Some of this info is only needed by viewer/gui.  Some by mdserver and engine.
It wasn't clear to me how to push this new engine-specific preference to the engine such that the avTransformManager would have it when needed.
I finally created a new engine RPC that saves the information in avtDatabaseFactory.Even adding the RPC was not an easy task, as more files than I knew actually had to be updated.  The engine compiled without all the additions needed, so when I had failure at runtime, I had to go digging to find what I missed.
I will start a wiki with information I gained from my experience, and will add the link when it is ready.

1. The viewer plugin info C code contains an extra copy of GetClientAttributes that contains 2 extra bool arguments. This code should probably not be generated since it is handled in the ViewerPlotPluginInfo base class.
2. The viewer plugin info C code's InitializePlotAttributes method passes a ViewerPlot and it used to be const to prevent the plugin from modifying the plot. That constness was relaxed recently. The header is right but the C code is still generated with a const, which is not right.
These 2 issues lead to incorrect skeleton code being generated.

This is very annoying. I am trying to save several differet files from visit and each one I want to type in a special name.
So, I go to File->Set save options, type in the name and hit the 'save' button. Then, the window disappears. So, I haveto back to File->Set save options again and again to save each time.

The new .mili header file format is a bit better in that it uses some keywords to help identify what each line is for (JSON would probably be even better though).
One of the new things the .mili header file captures in the path to the directory where the Mili family files can be found.
However, the combination of makemili, the .mili file format and the Mili plugin result in that the path must be an absolute path. I could not get '.' or other sensible relative paths to work.
This is largely a plugin problem but I think makemili should be fixed to stuff in a relative path there instead of an absolute one.
For now, this means you cannot generate a .mili file on one filesystem and then move the .mili+family files to another system without having to regenerate the .mili file.

Attached are two binary tecplot files. The mesh is in one file, the variables are in the other file...
If I open grid.plt, I can do a Mesh plot in VisIt.
However, opening grid.plt is not sufficient for VisIt to 'know about' the solution data in the companion solution.plt file.
Opening solution.plt works and there is a ""zone_1"" in the Mesh plot's submenu indicating it seems to know something about the mesh the solution data is defined on. However, attempts to plot any of the solution data variables cause VisIt's engine to crash.
I myself don't know too much about tecplot format. For example, I don't know if grid.plt should have information to 'point at' the mesh variables defined in solution.plt or whether solution.plt should 'point at' the mesh defined in grid.plt.

We use this type in several places but I dont think its handled consistently.
There are some issues I guess with this type because it is an optional part of the C9X types. That is, a system that is C9X compliant is not actually required to define the type. It may be defined. It may not me.
If we use conditional compilation logic to handle it, I would suggest we predicate that logic on whatever CMake provides for this. But, I don't know for sure if CMake handles it out of the box.
We currently use boost's cstdint.hpp header file that is in our third_party_builtin dir and I am not sure if that is the right way to handle it. First, it smears 'boost' references all over our code and I am not sure that is ok. I think cstdint.h header defines it too. I think <cstdint> defines it too but my OSX 10.8 system didn't have that header.
We should consistently use the same header for definition of int64_t everywhere.
We should consistently use the same conditional compilation logic for int64_t dependent code everywhere.

I'd think the transform checkbox (on the first page of the transform op) would tell it whether or not to apply the x/y/z scale factors to the vector component values.  Looks like it's only using the rotation information.
(I actually think we might need four values, not just two.  The coordinate (second page) transforms of this operator has four options, but instantaneous direction is no different from coordinate displacement for the xforms we do on this first page, so those four options are really three.  I'd take two options, though -- just leave the checkbox and continue to ignore translation.)
To replicate, open rect2d.silo, make a vector plot of vel, add a transform op, set scale X=0.1, Y=1, Z=1, and notice that whether or not you have the transform vectors checkbox checked, there's no change in the plot.

Hi Cyrus,
I have given you a file on the rz that demonstrates a bug in the visitonion peel operator.
It is a 3D polyhedral mesh (even though all the elements are really hexes).
If I plot
1. material filled boundary (ThreeD_Unstructured)2. mesh (ThreeD_Unstructured)3. subset of domains (ThreeD_Unstructured) (wireframe)
then apply operator to all plots
onion peel:set: domain4seed: 489layers: 0
You will see that the material filled boundary plot gets the correctzone, but the mesh and domain plot get the incorrect zone.
I think this is because visit in converting the hexes into 24 tets, sothe indexing is incorrect.
(Cyrus has the files on RZ.)

A few users have expressed desire to have a more complete ultra-like curve plotting and math capability directly in VisIt instead of having to use ultra.
We have done some work in this regard already in developing a set of sub-commands in VisIt's python CLI that mimic some of ultra's features.
However, not all ultra features map easily to VisIt curve expressions or operators and not all of ultra's commands were implemented and, inany event, we don't have the resources to implement many of the more advanced ultra features anyways.
Another option that is attractive is to provide ease of integration of VisIt curve data with numpy/scipy array objects. That means beingable to easily access a VisIt curve as a numpy/scipy array as well as easily plot a numpy/scipy array as a VisIt curve. So, its bi-directional.If this one capability was in VisIt, users would have the option of learning to do ultra-like things in numpy/scipy or just continuing touse ultra.
Note, there was apparently some attempt to implement ultra commands in python by a summer student;/usr/gapps/pdv/bin/pdv.Nonetheless, the work here does not involve wrapping numpy/scipy with ultra-like aliases. I don't think we should spend resourceson that. But, we should spend resources making easy to seamlessly work with VisIt curve data in numpy/scipy and vice-versa.

EXPORT_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES is deprecated in CMake, and will eventually be removed.
We currently use this to get the proper dep chain, and export it so linking will work for plugins.
Eventually, we will need to move to a solution using EXPORT + INSTALL.We will have to be clever about collecting target names.
Below is an email exchange from the VTK-dev list that can help us figure out a path forward:
(From Brad King)
On 10/24/2013 02:48 PM, Cyrus Harrison wrote:

The reason we were using EXPORT_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES is that we have we

EXPORT_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES gave us an easy automatic path to capture

CMake was quite easy due to the names of the targets we exclude.

You must have install(TARGETS) rules for them, no?

With EXPORT AND INSTALL, does each target need to be 
explicitly named?

Each target needs to be named in export(), but usually projectscollect the list of names in a global property and then look it upand export() once at the end of the configuration.
In install(EXPORT) one does not actually name targets.  Those go in
install(TARGETS ... DESTINATION ... EXPORT MyProject)
to associate them with a particular logical installation exportname.  Then install(EXPORT) creates and installs a file thatrefers to all the targets.
So you just need to update each install(TARGETS) rule for thetargets to be exported to add the extra ""EXPORT ..."" and thendo the install(EXPORT) in one place.

Teresa Bailey ran into this:
She has a silo file with 3 multi-meshes. One has a mmadj object describing structured domain boundaries. The others do no.
When she plots one of the two meshes that don't have dbis -- she gets this message:
Mesh()viewer: engine_par: avtStructuredDomainBoundries:: targetted  domain more than number of domains.
(note the misspelling targetted is in the error message, so that should help us find it quickly)
In this case the meshes that don't correspond to the dbi have more domains than the other mesh does -- this is not common, typically the meshes with dbi have largest domain count.
So I think this is an obvious bug that simply have not stumbled upon yet.  The sanity check is prevent us from creating the plot, when the dbis should just be ignored.

This is a bug report from the visitusers.org forum. http://visitusers.org/forum/YaBB.pl?num=1381324763
There are 2 domains and when both are plotted with the Mesh plot, the mesh looks plausible. When only the first domain is plotted, you can see the holes that are the source of the complaint. It might be that there needs to be some ghosting that is not implemented in the FLUENT reader to make it produce the best results.
Data and images are attached to this submission.

==========I am trying to load .cas files from a transient CFD simulation in Ansys FLUENT 14 that was run using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve shock waves in a flow field.
When I load the case into VisIt 2.6.3 and display the mesh, or try to plot any data, holes appear in the vicinity of the refined mesh. It looks to me like the nodes are not being connected properly when the mesh is loaded.
Some of the elements are displayed trapezoidal or triangular, whereas in the actual mesh, all of the elements are quadrilaterals and close to square in shape.

CLI & Engine should work under System/Alternate Python. Especially if we plan to allow on working with external Python installations.
Ideas: Update internallauncher to not set PYTHONHOME just for cli.Update PYTHONPATH to add VisIt's site-package directory even for System or Alternate installations.
Also, add PIP support and add simple python -c ""import <checks>"" to see if installation support VisIt requirements (numpy, rpy2, etc...) .

I believe that I've found an incompatibility between VisIt and CMake
2.8.12 (latest release). If I try to manually make the Silo plugin (or
any other plugin), I get the following:

(VisIt 2.7.0 was installed into /usr/local/visit from the

However, using CMake 2.8.11.2 (or any earlier version) I get no problems.

The issue seems to be that at line 412 of PlusinVsInstall.cmake:

is expected to set currentDefs = NOTFOUND but as of CMake 2.8.12 it
sets it to an empty string.

I'm not sure whether this is a wrong assumption in VisIt or a
regression in CMake. The error seems to occur for VisIt 2.6.3 as well,
but I haven't checked earlier versions.

Please could someone confirm this and determine where the problem lies?

1647,Resolved,Bug,Normal, Python state object generation a little broken for objects that have a base class. ,Mark Miller,-,2.7.2,Brad Whitlock,11/07/2013,,0%,2.00 hours,11/07/2013 02:05 pm,02/24/2014 08:15 pm,2 - Rare,3 - Major Irritation,2.7.0,,,All,Any,"
Suppose I have state object A which is the base class for object B and I generate Python bindings for them using xml2python. Suppose A has fields x,y and B adds field z.
This works:b = B()b.x = 5
This appears to work but sets an error that stops the script:b = B()b.z = 5
The issue is how _setattr is implemented in the Python bindings. B_setattr calls A_setattr first and attempts to set field ""z"" but since A does not have a field ""z"" an error condition is set. The remaining code in B_setattr works but since A_setattr set an error, the script later fails. B_setattr needs to clear the error set by A_setattr before going on to the rest of its code. Then it works.
In GeneratePython.h, change:        if (custombase)
        {            c << ""    if (Py""<<baseClass<<""_setattr(self, name, args) != -1)"" << Endl;            c << ""        return 0;"" << Endl;            c << Endl;        }
to:
if (custombase)
{            c << ""    if (Py""<&lt;baseClass<<""_setattr(self, name, args) != -1)"" << Endl;            c << ""        return 0;"" << Endl;            c << ""    else"" << Endl;            c << ""        PyErr_Clear();"" << Endl;            c << Endl;        }

There may be performance implications I do not appreciate here, but I frequently find it very counter-intuitive when I am display say both a mesh and a filledboundary plot and happen to have the mesh plot 'active' that when I pick, I do not get material information. I wind up having to select the material plot and re-pick (cluttering my view with a new pick).
I think default behavior for pick should be to return information about all plots currently being displayed. If a mesh plot is displayed with a PC plot, then it should return mesh (node/zone info) and PC plot variable info. If, in addition (not realistic example but illustrative) a filled boundary plot is also being displayed, then it should return material information as well as material specific variable information.

Randy Settgast had a test dataset for something he was working on in Ale3d. I've attached it here. It is 3 hexs in a row. The two outer hexes have material A and the middle hex has a mix of materials B & C. So, the one and only mixing zone doesn't have any materials in common with the (few) neighboring zones.
Default MIR gets it wrong and displays the middle hex as a clean zone. PLIC gets it right.
I am thinking it would be good to add logic to MIR to check that if MIR did not cut any zones but that the input mesh does indeed have mixed zones (with significant volume fractions) then issue a warning that it is a possible degenerate case and to attempt an alternate MIR.

I ran valgrind on the viewer and found a large leak with the ExpressionList objects created by operator plugins (look for GetCreatedExpressions in the viewer). Nearly all of the cases where that method is called in the viewer results in memory leaks. A bunch of operators create expressions now and for large variable lists this leaks several megabytes. This would probably eventually take down the viewer when playing through animations of datasets that have time-varying metadata.

In any event, IMHO, the problem was that Fady had use -q tecplot in his .cshrc file. That put /usr/local/tools/tecplot/bin/ffmpeg in his path ahead of /usr/bin/ffmpeg. The default behavior of the use command is to pre-pend and not ap-pend to the path.

I spent just an hour marching through all VisIts ~2800 image outputs and noted any that caught my eye as perhaps requiring re-baselining at a higher resolution, say 1Kx1K. The list I compiled here is not necessarily complete and I freely admit I was somewhat arbitrary in choosing which images caught my eye for closer examination. There are perhaps other 50% more images that would appear to fit in this group also that I simply overlooked.

Problem of type 1: Plot too small
	

This is an easily fixed problem but thought I would point it out anyways. Most of the image is blank. The solution is to ensure plot fills as much of available image real estate as possible. We aren't checking for this in testing and maybe we should compute the pixel coverage metrics and initially warn a developer of a would-be baseline image of this kind before committing and using it in testing.


Problem of type 2: Image too small to reveal important details,
	

This image is supposed to demonstrate VisIt's ability to deal with ""missing data"" where some data is plotted but some values in the input are missing but I think it is just as likely that missing and non-missing data points are landing in the same pixel masking the intended effect of the test.


Problem of type 3: Image being used where non-image comparison        would be better
	

This image is a curve plot. Why not just compare the actual curve data instead of some rendered version of the plot, especially for plots with wide dynamic range, a lot of the little variations are washed out in any image reasonably sized or not. At 300x300 image size, we're saying any variations less than a third of a percent are not relevant.


Problem of type 4: 2D input scene too busy.
	

2D rendering involves resolving the color at each pixel. When input scene geometry density is too high, many primitives map to the same pixel. What we see then in a 300x300 is determined somewhat by an arbitrary order of operations. The same scene presented in a different ordering will result in a different. Maybe I am confusing or planar 3D issues with true 3D issues here though.


Problem of type 4b: 3D input scene too busy.
	

This is the same as 4 but with 3D data. It isn't clear to me whether 3D rendering has the ability to improve or make worse the problem of input scene primitive density being too high. On the one hand, there is an additional dimension used to disambiguate what gets drawn to a pixel. So, it sounds like 3D ought to be less sensitive to this problem. On the other hand, just looking at the image visually, I am not sure I can say for sure that the rendered output is what I was expecting.


Problem of type 5: Lighting, shading or view angle obscures important details
	

In this example, shading and angle to eye is such that 3D input scene variation is washed out. This isn't true of the whole image here but is true of a large portion of it. If we employ metrics to determine image diffs, this kind of image result has the ability to dilute the metric.


Problem of type 6
	

Basically the same as 4 but in this case, we are testing a 'scatter plot' in VisIt. So, the sort of funky shape and appearance is indeed what we want to test.


Problem of type 7: Key details from calculational work performed by VisIt not rendered at fine enough detail.
	

This is testing a very important capability in VisIt: Material Interface Reconstruction (MIR). It is testing one of several MIR algorithms and key aspects of the result I think are muddied by image size and/or choice in view zoom.


If we embarked on an effort to improve our choices for test images, the examples above might serve as a good starting point on how to improve things. In addition, we should consider things like sensitivity of test results to irrelevant changes such as in compilers, third-party-libraries, running at single our double precision, parallel rendering vs. serial rendering, etc. In addition, just because an image exhibits one or more of the problems mentioned here doesn't mean the whole image isn't testing something useful. But it does mean that the non-useful portions of the image wind up diluting any metrics we might choose to use as a means of disambiguating acceptable differences from unacceptable ones.
For certain, to zero-order an across the board re-baseline to 1kx1k image size would help to reduce though probably not in all cases fix these issues. It would likely also help to prevent us from introducing new issues of these same kind. The only downside is an increase in storage needed for baseline dir in our repository and subsequent checkouts. Given the current size of our repository on NERSC systems, ~1.5Gb, the increased storage would be 2-3%, so really not much. There would be about a doubling of the size of a checkout of the test directory. Where image results are posted for browsing, we would probably have to reduce the number of months we maintain previous test results from maybe 6 to 4.
Honestly, to sift through ~2800 images and identify just those we think should be re-baslined at 1kx1k as opposed to just doing all of them isn't really worth the trouble, particularly when the only thing it saves us is 100-200 megabytes of disk space. Disk space is cheap. Developer time isn't.

I think it would be good to add catching of floating point exceptions (FPEs) to VisIt's coreexception handling. Although it appears C++ has some built-incapability for things named ""underflow"" or ""overflow"". several sources on the web explain that C++ exceptions are softwarerelated and not at all the same as FPE exceptions which are hardwarerelated. The latter tend to be caught by the CPU, handled by the OS andsent to the offending process via signals (use sigaction() interface).
I don't know how easily this would integrate with VisIt's normalexception handling but I'd guess it would go something like this...

set up sigactions to catch a prescribed list of FPEs (underflow,overflow, divide-by-zero)
add signal handlers that receive FPE signals and then package that upinto a new class of VisIt exception
add, where appropriate, catches for this new class of VisIt exceptionin our filters/pipelines

Since something like divide-by-zero can happen in many circumstances involving user input and data from external files, the granularity at which we decide to catch such exceptions is probably very important. For example, if we caught them only at the very top-level in the engine, a plot with only one value among millions causing a problem amoung millions would wind up not plotting anything instead of maybe plotting everything but with one data value set to some MAX value say. In fact, maybe it makes sense to employ VisIt's missing data funtionality to allow us to gracefully handle FPEs but warn the user of their occurence.
One other thing that occured to me when looking up how to catch FPE signals is the opportunity to perhaps recover from SEGVs. We can catch this condition as a signal and then maybe issue a warning message to the user (albiet probably not clean up all that tidily from the error) and give the user a chance to save a session and/or exit from VisIt more gracefully.
I think this would only ever have to be done on the engine.

Boyce Griffith reported this

Are there settings that can be used to control the resolution scaling for
VisIt.app in OS X?  I am trying to use a prebuilt executable of VisIt on
a MacBook with retina display, and the default scaling generates very
grainy text.  This can be fixed by changing the scaling of *everything*
to More Space, but Id prefer to keep the scaling at Best for
everything but VisIt.

If this can be addressed by building from source, I can do that  I am
using the prebuilt executables because I ran into some issues between
clang and Qt when trying to build VisIt 2.6.3.  (Maybe these are fixed
with 2.7?)

Thanks!

Honestly, I am not able to see the difference on my MacBook Pro but my vision isn't that good either.
The attached image, when you zoom in, you see a clear difference in the text rendered in VisIt's GUI and the text rendered by, for example, the terminal app. Note that I had to zoom in on the image before my eyese could see the difference.

we want/need optional things to have 'no value' in the file. So, unless the data producer explicitly specifies a REPR_IDX, it won't ever appear in the file. So, how can a data consumer reading such a file know that REPR_IDX was  not specified? The value, -1, means it is not specified in the file. Using a value of 'zero' for not specified doesn't work because zero could indeed be a valid REPR_IDX. So, to accomodate all this, the silo library stores the vaue minus one in the file and then adds one when it reads it back.
Ok, so how come browser gets it right but silex gets it wrong? Well, Silex is not written at the highest level of abstraction. So, it doesn't ever call DBGetMultimesh() or DBGetUcdvar(). Instead, it calls DBGetObject() (the generic object interface). Generic objects don't understand all these nitty gritty details (though in writing this email to you I am thinking I could enhance them to do this properly) and so the 
Woe! Wait a minute. I am looking at some logic in Silo library now about how this is handled and found an even nastier twist on it that I need to change. The +1 occurs when the value is inserted into the optlist itself, not just before writing it to the file! That is way bad! Who is the idiot that did that? Oh wait, I did that when I implemented it.
Ok, now I've convinced myself you have found a clear bug though it isn't the one you originally contacted me over. I think linkage from Silo to VisIt should work fine in spite of this issue. Silex presently displays the wrong value and that will be correted. Use browser if in doubt.

Using 'no resolution constraint' and width=1024, height=2048, resulting
image size 1024x1178

Using 'no resolution constraint' and width=2048, height=4096, resulting
image size 1600x1178.

My conclusion:  there is an image size max of 1600x1178.  Not sure why,
so I guess it is time for more investigation.

I checked on my Mac

OK, so I tried to go further on my mac; 4kx4k went fine. But, 8kx8k failed
in a strange way; only one quarter of the image got rendered. It went into

Dan Laney ran into this

Now that we have put to rest the off by one I saw in Silex, I decided to give you the files that generated the initial questions.  I am seeing errors in both VisIt 2.6.3 and 2.7.1

Please focus on only the Segments/* stuff.  There is  Segments/Mesh, which VisIt  plots just fine.  When I try to plot a pseudocolor of either Segments/segments_vc or Segments/segments_sc, VisIt produces the following message:

""The compute engine running on host rzalastor2.llnl.gov issued the following warning: In domain 1, your zonal variable ""Segments/Segments_sc"" has 0 values, but it should have 4.  Extra 0.'s were added to ensure VisIt runs smoothly."" 

When I look at this file in Silex, the multimesh and multifields both indicate that Domain 1 (really 0, due to that inc/dec thingy you found), is the REPR_IDX to get metadata.  Domain 0 has data, and Domain 1 does not, but VisIt somehow appears to be using the mesh size from Domain 0 to set the expected size of domain 1.

Can you shed any light on this behavior?

On a Mac laptop, the standard scroll gesture is to swipe two fingers on the finger pad.
Surprisingly, this does have the effect of zooming VisIt's image in and out. Is that intentional/desireable? I think it is, maybe but its worth discussing proper behavior.
In any event, like many GUI behaviors I see on the Mac, the behavior is sporadic and often results in the the image quickly oscillating in zoom in and out around the initial state of the view before the swipe gesture begins. Other times, it seems to work much more smoothly.

Had a use case with a 2D molecule plot, but the desired rendering was to have the atoms be rendered as spheres (with shading) instead of flat circles.

Brief synopsis of the test:  Create 3 .visit files for the wave databases, (different names), to test database correlations with three windows locked in time.
The test prints out DatabaseCorrelation Information, Window Information, as well as the normal SaveWindow tests.
timelock_09 prints window information, including currently active timesliders. On windows, the correlation time slider for window 3 is not being listed. I believe this is the source of the failures for tests 10 and 12 as well.
timelock_08 is also demonstrating an issue with annotations re-appearing.
When I run timelock.py directly  with visit -cli, I notice that after the call to 'SetTimeSliderState(36)', none of the windows update as they should, being locked in time.  Window 3 will update to the correct time state if I click the window header to make it the 'active' window from Windows perspective.  Windows 1 and 2 do not update (demonstrating VisIt does not consider them correlated with window 3).
The information for Correlation01 shows all 3 databases (wave.visit, wave1.visit and wave2.visit) being part of the correlation.
Getting inconsistent results when calling 'TimeSliderNextState' with different windows active.Sometimes they work, sometimes I get:
VisIt: Warning - VisIt did not set the time state for these windows: 1, 2.The time slider in cannot be set by the active window's time slider since the correlations of the time sliders have nothing in common.
To avoid this warning in the future, make sure that locked windows have compatible time sliders.1L
'TimeSliderNextState' more frequently at least updates the active window'TimeSliderSetState', the window doesn't updated until Windows thinks it is the active window.

OK - let's drop the --uintah flag for a second.   Let's say that I want tobuild mpich.   I don't have any openmpi or mpich implementation on mysystem.
So, I add ""--parallel --mpich"" to my build_visit command line so that itwill build mpich for me.     I'm also supposed to set a PAR_COMPILER flag?Presumably, I don't have a parallel implementation on my system yet (since mpich hasn't been built) so there's no mpicc, mpic++.  So, I set the environment variable PAR_COMPILER=g++, and I get the same error as described below.

Steve Langer reported that an offsite user is unable to get client server working to the RZ through VPN. Here is the text of Steve's e-mail.
Eric:
This is a follow-up to the problems Mike Purvis was having in using Visit to visualize HYDRA runs on the RZ from his office in San Diego. Mike is now dragging HYDRA dump sets from rzmerl to cab (using rzslic). Visit works fine in client-server mode to the CZ, so he is up and running.
In the longer term, I would like to find a way for the client-server mode to work when someone accesses the RZ through an LLNL VPN. LLNL's VPN is currently set up so that all network traffic goes through the VPN. It used to be that only traffic for llnl.gov addresses was routed through the VPN. This change might have had a significant impact on client-server mode.
It has been several years since I worked with Brad on the port usage of the client-server mode. If I remember correctly, you launch the data engine by ssh'ing a command to the machine where the data engine is supposed to run. That command tells the data engine the ""name"" and port on which the visit client is listening for a connection. I don't remember how it gets the ""name"" of the desktop computer. The proper name to use isn't completely obvious because the hostname changes when the VPN is fired up.
If visit uses the ""VPN name"", the network traffic will come back through the VPN and the connection should be made OK. If visit uses the original hostname, the traffic should try and go directly to the laptop. The LLNL firewall allows outbound traffic on the visit port, but the laptop no longer responds to its pre-VPN name and the connection should fail. As near as I can tell from Mike's description, client-server mode fails for him when the data engine tries to connect back to the client.
Have you guys tested client-server mode through the VPN since the VPN was changed to route everything? If not, could you check what name is used when the engine tries to connect back to the server? I think it needs to be something like vpnXXXX.llnl.gov
Thanks,Steve

1714,Pending,Feature,Normal, Cannot apply transform operator to Time Curve plots ,-,-,-,Paul Selby,01/28/2014,,0%,,01/28/2014 01:32 pm,02/05/2014 11:26 am,,,2.12.3,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"
We have a user who would like to be able to apply the transform operator to Time Curve plots to more easily compare results from different simulations. Unfortunately this isn't currently possible - the operator can be added but an error dialog is displayed when attempting to render.
Presumably this is because the curve isn't a ""real"" data source? The error message seems to be produced by the engine's NetworkManager::AddFilter function
Similarly it isn't possible to apply operators to lineout curves (see #1085) but in this case ViewerPlot::AddOperator displays a (less cryptic) warning dialog when attempting to add the operator.
Both cases can be worked around by outputting the curve via ""Save Window"" or ""Export Database"" and reading it back in.
Steps to reproduce

Load wave*.silo database from visit/data
Add pressure Pseudocolor plot
Tick ""Do Time Curve with next pick"" in ""Time Pick"" tab of Controls->Pick... dialog and Apply
Do nodal pick
Make Curve Window active and add transform operator to curve
Click Draw => get ""Curve: (ImproperUseException) viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly.""

If I call RestoreSessionWithDifferentSources from cli, without explicitly listing the host (eg localhost), then I see this message: VisIt: Error - VisIt cannot launch a metadata server on host .
I will get my plot, but no Time Sliders (eg only 1 time state).
However, if I add ""localhost:/path/to/data"" to my cli call, then all works as expected.
Don't know if its a user-education issue (eg, always list the host even if its local), or if the session restore mechanism needs to be updated to figure out the host if one isn't provided.
Ran across this while attempting to update session files for our test suite.  Many are on the skip list, some because of this issue.  T

This was reported by Greg Fischer.
The attached files represent the same object in both Silo and binary tecplot format.
When I do a filled boundary plot of 'material' from the silo file in VisIt, it eats over 8 gigs of memory and then cores. This is our current trunk on Linux.
Greg was testing on Windows and had similar problems; memory bloat and eventual crash of engine.
Additionally, the same data from Tecplot takes 3x longer to read and put up a mesh plot and renders each frame much, much slower.
Greg Fischer says Tecplot itself handles the tecplot file fine.

Cyrus did a short test of aa features in VTK-6 and found some good results (at the expense of extra renders).
See ticket #74 for more details.
Cyrus also observed that our current aa appears to affect only annotations.
We should consider what improved aa support we can now offer with VTK-6.
It may be that most users kinda sorta handle this manually already by rendering to 4k x 4k images and then resizing to smaller. So, I honestly don't know how common a use case it would be to use anti-aliasing. Given that I don't recall seeing a single email on the topic, I have rated expected use as exceptional.

From Andreas' original email:
I was trying to link against libsim and didn't find a FindVisIt.cmaketo set the lib/include paths auto-magically for me, so I wrote onemyself. The attached file is pretty basic, so any improvements arewelcome. Or is there already a mature implementation available whichI've simply overlooked?
The package may be used from a CMakeLists.txt via:

find_package(VisIt)
if(VISIT_FOUND)
include_directories(${VisIt_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(my_exe ${LOCAL_LIBGEODECOMP_LINK_LIB} dl ${VisIt_LIBRARIES})
endif()

The provided sample FindVisIt.cmake code:
===============================

- Tries to find VisIt
You may define VisIt_ROOT to hint at the install location. Once done this will define
 VisIt_FOUND - VisIt is installed
 VisIt_INCLUDE_DIRS - Directories where VisIt headers can be found
 VisIt_LIBRARIES - Libraries required by VisIt headers

set(VisIt_VERSIONS 2.4.0 2.4.1 2.4.2 2.5.0 2.5.1 2.5.2 2.6.0 2.6.1 2.6.2)set(VisIt_ARCHITECTURES linux-x86_64)set(VisIt_CANDIDATES /opt/visit /opt/visit/visit ${VisIt_ROOT})set(VisIt_SUFFIXES)foreach(version ${VisIt_VERSIONS})  foreach(arch ${VisIt_ARCHITECTURES})    list(APPEND VisIt_SUFFIXES ${version}/${arch}/libsim/V2)  endforeach()endforeach()

find_package_handle_standard_args(VisIt DEFAULT_MSG VisIt_INCLUDE_DIRS VisIt_LIBRARIES)mark_as_advanced(VisIt_INCLUDE_DIRS VisIt_LIBRARIES)
========================================================
And in a later response, another user added this:
=============================================================Thank you Andreas for this FindVisIt.cmake, it's very useful.
For those like me who use the VisIt source directory instead of an installation path, you may want to add the following at line 24 of this FindVisIt.cmake:
list(APPEND VisIt_INC_SUFFIXES sim/V2/lib)list(APPEND VisIt_LIB_SUFFIXES lib)
In the source directory libsim is indeed in sim/V2/lib, not in libsim/V2.To properly find VisIt from its sources, use (for example with version 2.5.2)set(VisIt_ROOT path/to/visit2.5.2/src)
=======================================
Depending on how much we want to delve into cmake-isms for our installs, there are other cmake files we might want to add to our install (looking at the installs for vtk/xdmf/hdf5(when built with cmake)):
VisItConfig.cmakeVisItVersion.cmakeVisItTargets.cmakeVisItTargets-release.cmakeVisItLibraryDepends.cmake
Most projects places these files in a 'CMake' subdirectory of lib when installed.

Some ideas on implementation off the top of my head:
Perhaps material_names as a non-cell/non-point associated FIELD  array (stored before the POINTS or COORDINATE arrays in an ascii vtk file).
We would need to know how to associate with material id.  I dont think we should assume that materials ids start with 0 and increase incrementally by 1 J  So we would probably need another array that associates material_names index with material id.
Though Ive never stored strings in a vtk file (or at least havent attempted it in a very long while).

I've attached a file of a Label plot image I was able to produce with small changes to Silo plugin and Label Plot plugin.
The goal is to support labels longer than a single ascii character.
point, quad and ucdvars from VisIt can have many components and we load those as vector variables in VisIt and add the 'treat-as-ascii' optlist option in Silo.
Some minor changes to silo plugin (to serve up more than 3-component vectors for example) and to avtVectorMetaData (to add treatAsASCII bool) were added.
Should I commit all this?

I had some data up that I wanted to export to Silo. I opened up the Export DB window and added some extra variables to the list and exported to Silo. When I tried plotting my exported file, I did not find any of the variables that I had exported. I figured it might be a problem with the variable names so I made expressions with better names that referenced the ugly variable names from the original data file. When I exported again, the resulting file had the variables that I cared about.
Later, when I quit out of VisIt, there were a bunch of Silo error messages on the console:
DBPutUcdvar1: Invalid variable name - only alphanumeric and `_': UCDvar name ""Velocity Vectors [PLOT3D]"" is an invalid name.  Silo variable names may contain only alphanumeric characters or the _ character.

The engine crashes.
I looked into this a little and it happens when the vector field is an expression. I tried on another dataset where I could reproduce the crash using the vector expression. If I exported the vector field to a new Silo file and plotted that Silo file then the Streamline plot worked. This is why I'm saying that the vector has to be produced via expressions.
I think there are multiple problems here that are causing the engine to fail later because of an invalid cell locator pointer.

1748,Pending,Bug,Low, Can no longer include special characters in VisIt Text Annotation - since VisIt 2.7.0 ,-,-,-,Matthew Wheeler,02/24/2014,,0%,,02/24/2014 11:14 am,03/25/2014 12:41 pm,2 - Rare,2 - Minor Irritation,2.7.0,,,Linux,Any,"
The ability to produce certain special characters such as  (mu) seems to havedisappeared with VisIt 2.7.0 (which moved to VTK 6.0), and in later versions.
With VisIt 2.6.3 and before, there were a few different ways to get certainspecial characters (32-255) into a Text Annotation.
e.g.
1) In a Python script using the hex representation of the character.   (see for example xfd)
Txt2D = CreateAnnotationObject(""Text2D"")      Txt2D.text = ""size 10\xb5m""
would produce:
size 10m
2)  You could also get the same result using a Unicode specification:
TxtU2D = CreateAnnotationObject(""Text2D"")      TxtU2D.text = ""size 10""+  u'\N{MICRO SIGN}'.encode('latin-1') + ""m""
3)  Using a combination of keystrokes to type in the special character:
On my keyboard at least, I can get mu by typing the right hand AltGr and m        -> 
This character can either be:
3a) Typed directly into the Text field of an Annotation Object.
or:
3b) Typed into a script.        (Note however that you then also need to put a special encoding comment        into the top of the script so that the Python pre-processor will         interpret the source file correctly.)

*- coding: latin-1 -*        ...      TxtM2D = CreateAnnotationObject(""Text2D"")      TxtM2D.text = ""size 10m""

With the newer versions of VisIt (2.7.0 onwards), whatever method you use,the special character just seems to get filtered out and the string closes up.
(With a future development version, the whole string seems to disappear if aspecial character is found in it)
We are wondering if the ability was lost with the move to VTK 6.0.(Could it be as simple a some extra configuration flag ?)

Wayne Miller ran into this.
He is up and running using client/server now.
But, here is what I discovered

I tried both Cygwin-X and Exceed-X. VisIt 2.6.3 and 2.7.1 die same way on both though it also crashes Cygwin-X server too but not Exceed-X server.
I could run visit -nowin fine and save an image. So, it has something to do with GL. glxgears ran fine.
I saved debug logs and I was able to get a stack dump of viewer and gave a txt file to myself of the dump. The last few function calls on the stack are
Viewer: indirect_init.c:497 _glxNewindirectAPI: Assertion o>0 failed
Visits viewer exited abnormally

__glxIndirectNewAPI (/usr/lib64/libGL.so.1)
glxMakeCurrentReadSGI
QGLContext::makeCurrent
QMetaObject::activate
vtkCallbackCommand::Execute

Note: I am a little suprised I got function symbol names from the viewer'S core file. Doesn't that mean we're running a debug version of VisIt or at the very least, something that isn't strippped? I mean, that is probably ok but wanted to ask if others are suspect of the fact I was able to get a useful stack dump from the viewer's core file?

This bug comes from the visitusers.org forum. It looks like there is an error in the ADIOS plugin. It looks like dims0 = m->dimensions0; is supposed to be dims2 = m->dimensions0;
Here is the email.
I am using ADIOS I/O format and I want to visualize the contents of my .bp file with VisIt 2.7.1. At present time, I successfully built VisIt with the required dependencies from reading such files and I successfully opened a .bp file and visualized a 3D data thanks to the Contour method. However, I also want to visualize the mesh which is associated to this 3D data and it fails.I am using the Adios VizSchema APIs to generate the data and the associated rectilinear 3D mesh. After some investigations, I think that there is a bug within the following file in the VisIt sources :
visit2.7.1/src/databases/ADIOS/avtADIOSSchemaFileFormat.C
... and more precisely by the end of MakeRectilinearMesh :
else if (m->num_dimensions == 3)
{        dims[0] = m->dimensions[2];        dims[1] = m->dimensions[1];        dims[0] = m->dimensions[0];        rg->SetXCoordinates(xyz[2]);        rg->SetYCoordinates(xyz[1]);        rg->SetZCoordinates(xyz[0]);    }
... I think that there is something wrong with the filling of the array dims in the 3D case.
What should I do to bypass this problem ? I may use the Structured mesh format (which is ok) but it is more memory consuming than Rectilinear format.
Many thanks in adv

I updated my libraries using build_visit from the trunk and ran the test suite and was not able to do any image differences. This happened because PIL did not build correctly. I tried building PIL directly after the fact. PIL was not able to get the right freetype includes to work, which must have been installed via MacPorts in /opt/local/include/freetype2. PIL wanted to look for the headers in /opt/local/include and then individual includes were assuming that the ""freetype"" directory existed. Well, on this system, the freetype headers were in the ""freetype2"" directory. I don't know whether that's common or because I have MacPorts packages installed. It would be nice if build_visit could check for freetype in a couple places and then doctor the setup.py for PIL to find the installed freetype.

I worked around this by creating a symlink to freetype2 called ""freetype"" in my /opt/local/include directory, but this required admin access and it may not be the best way forward.
Question: With PIL getting distributed with VisIt (because it's installed in the CLI) and requiring a freetype library, what's the likelihood that PIL will work in a VisIt binary other than where it was built? Does freetype need to be part of the VisIt build?

From Flavio Calvo's email to the users list:
Dear Sir or Madam,
I contact you concerning a memory leak problem when using together the Geometry>Resample and Slicing>Slice operators with a large amount of data. More precisely, I have the following problem: I am instrumenting a simulation using libsim, and after using VisIt some time with the simulation, the simulation gets killed.
After monitoring memory usage when running VisIt with the simulation, I found that normally, when adding operators to variables, memory is allocated and when the operators are removed memory is deallocated. However, in some precise circumstances (when both the Geometry>Resample and Slicing>Slice operators are active and the simulation mesh is very big) the memory is not deallocated after adding and removing a new operator.
This problem can be reproduced using the fscalar.f file from https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/2.0.0/GettingDataIntoVisItExamples2.0.0.tar.gz (this is part of the didactic code you provide with the tutorial ""Getting data into Visit""). Actually, the mesh in fscalar.f is very small and the problem does not manifest. However I join to this e-mail a slightly modified version of fscalar.f instrumenting a big mesh called ""mesh3d2"" and corresponding scalar data on the mesh named ""zonal2"". When running fscalar (as a simulation) instrumented with VisIt, the problem can be reproduced in this way:1.    Add>Pseudocolor>zonal22.    Operators>Geometry>Resample3.

Monitor total memory usage. For example in Linux 'ps -A | grep fscalar' outputs '26843 pts/7    00:00:00 fscalar', so the PID is 26843, and then the command 'pmap -x 26843 | grep total' outputs 'total kB          930408  661096  618068', ie 930408kB used.8.    Add any operator, for example 'Geometry>Dual mesh' and immediately remove it (no need to draw in between).9.    Draw10.    Check again for memory. This time I get 'total kB         1406704 1137308 1094248', ie 1406704kB used.So that when adding and removing 'Geometry>Dual mesh' (but it also happend with any other operator), memory usage raises from 930408kB to 1406704kB.
When doing the very same manipulation without resampling or without slicing there is no memory leak at all. If instead you repeat the same manipulation (with resampling and slicing) but with a smaller mesh, there is no memory leak either.
As I am working with very big meshes, resampling is required in order to visualize the data fluently. Moreover, slicing is often needed, so that even if this problem seems very uncommon and hard to reproduce, it can be quite inconvenient when dealing with large amount of data. As I said, after using VisIt for some time with these memory leaks, the simulation gets killed by the operating system (more precisely after it requests more memory than available...).
I am using in the server side Visit 2.7.1 with libsim V2 (the most recent Visit binaries available in the official website), and Visit 2.7.1 compiled from sources in the client side (I have a 32bits machine and you do not provide 32bits binaries).
I also tried to replace VISIT_OWNER_SIM by VISIT_OWNER_VISIT and VISIT_OWNER_COPY in the simulations instrumentation but the problem remains the same.

Here is Jean's e-mail:
hello there
on our Crays at CSCS, we use SLURM, on top of Cray's own scheduler aprun.I have found that the internallauncher passes the wrong -N option to aprun (this is different than srun)
as per the man page of aprun, -N indicates the number of processing elts per node.     [-N | --pes-per-node pes_per_node ]
I therefore patched our internallauncher to the following; Otherwise the jobs don't run because resources are not enabled.
184,186c184,185<         #if self.parallel.nn != None:<             #parcmd = parcmd + [""-N"", self.parallel.nn]<         parcmd = parcmd + [""-N"", self.PPN]---

if self.parallel.nn != None:
parcmd = parcmd + [""-N"", self.parallel.nn]530d528<             mpicmd = mpicmd + [""-N"", self.PPN]

I'd appreciate if this patch (against v 2.7.1) would be included in the next version of VisIt.I have verified that it works as required.

Currently if you press the Ctrl key and the left mouse button when in zoom mode the image pans.

Richard Sharp mentioned this was an annoyance for him.
A common means of raising a window in most window managers is moving the mouse into the window and then clicking anywhere in that window.
When using VisIt with multiple VisIt windows open, a user may naturally need to raise various windows frequently. There is, of course, a way to do that via the VisIt main panel by pulling down the menu of windows and selecting one to be active. But, that interface is not as intuitive as simply finding the window visually on the screen and clicking in it.
Depending on the window mode the VisIt window is in (e.g. if it is in 'pick' mode), then clicking in the window to raise it, does raise the window but also generates an error message from VisIt, ""Chosen pick did not intersect surface"", which then must be dismissed. Note that in navigation mode, zoom mode or lineout mode, such an error message does not get presented. For lineout and zoom, even if the click in the window is followed by an inadvertent slight drag, if the neither the click or drag intersect the viewport, no lineout or zoom event is triggered in VisIt nor is any error message and so the effect for the user is just that the window is raised. That is the desired behavior I think.
Now, the same is not quite true for navigation mode. In navigation mode, even if the click and inadvertent subsequent drag do*not intersect the viewport, a view change event is nonetheless triggered and the window is raised. Actually, I think a majority of viewer window operations wind up getting handled this way. That is both the window is raised and the VisIt action identified by the gesture is performed.


So, depending on the VisIt window mode, we have at least 3 different behaviours for how VisIt responds to attempts by a user to raise-by-clicking a window...
	
raise window, perform action whenever its makes sense (navigate mode)
raise window, ignore action if its nonsensical (lineout, rubber band zoom)
raise window, generate error message if its nonsensical (node/zone pick)



Some options to consider
	
eliminate the 3rd behavior (e.g. warning message generation) but that might mean we loose the message also in cases where its more useful to the user
if the initial click in the window results in a raise event, perform the raise only (e.g. ignore the initial click-to-raise click). While this kinda makes the most sense to me, I also think it represents a different kind of behaviour for the way VisIt operates a majority of time and so may now introduce confusion/annoyance for more users.

The expression ""array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 0) + array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 1)"" is incorrectly evaluated as ""2*array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 0)"" instead of the proper sum. According to Cyrus, this error is due to how the expression parser caches variable names and does not take non-variable arguments into account.
To reproduce use the following script:
OpenDatabase(""data/noise.silo"")DefineScalarExpression(""comp0"", ""array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 0)"")DefineScalarExpression(""comp1"", ""array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 1)"")DefineScalarExpression(""sum0"", ""array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 0) + array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 1)"")DefineScalarExpression(""sum1"", ""comp0 + comp1"")DefineScalarExpression(""test"", ""2*comp0"")DefineScalarExpression(""diff0"", ""abs(sum1-sum0)"")DefineScalarExpression(""diff1"", ""test-sum0"")AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""diff0"")DrawPlots()ChangeActivePlotsVar(""diff1"")

My summary from the Mar 12 2014 user's list:--------------------An update: The desired variance here was the one approximating the continuous function that we assume the discrete values are sampling.
So in other words, VisIt is probably a the ""variance"" equivalent of the ""variable weighted sum"" query.
Turns out there are two fairly effective workarounds:
1) You can do something pretty close by simply resampling to a regular grid.  I suspect that only works properly if your original data is perfectly covered by rectangular bounds, though.
2) But you can actually just use the ""Variable Weighted Sum"" (VWS for short) query directly using the alternative formulation for variance.  Specifically, run the VWS query on your variable, then run it again on the square of your variable, then subtract the square of the first from the second.  In other words the continuous variance of x = VWS - VWS^2.

We have encountered a bug in VisIt 2.7.1 with the Onion Peel Operator applied to a Filled Boundary (or a Mesh) Plot of a Multi-domain dataset where a seed is specified by a global cell id. This can be demonstrated with the global_node.silo test dataset by applying the OnionPeel operator with a global id seed to a Filled Boundary Plot or a Mesh Plot
To reproduce:
OpenDatabase(""global_node.silo"", 0)  AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""p"", 1, 1)  AddPlot(""FilledBoundary"", ""mat"", 1, 1)  AddPlot(""Mesh"", ""mesh"", 1, 1)
  #  SetActivePlots((0, 1, 2))  AddOperator(""OnionPeel"", 1)  OnionPeelAtts = OnionPeelAttributes()  OnionPeelAtts.adjacencyType = OnionPeelAtts.Node  OnionPeelAtts.useGlobalId = 1  OnionPeelAtts.index = (2000) # (or whatever)  OnionPeelAtts.seedType = OnionPeelAtts.SeedCell  SetOperatorOptions(OnionPeelAtts, 1)
  #  DrawPlots()  SaveWindow()
You will see that the selected Pseudocolor cell is in the right place but the Filled Boundary and Mesh cell is not at the seed specified. In serial you will see two highlighted cells  the correct Pseudocolor one and the Filled Boundary/Mesh cell which looks as if it is at cell 0 of the first processor domain. Note also that the result you get seems to depend on how many processors you use with the multi-domain dataset e.g. with -np 16 processors specified you get cell 0 on each of the first(?) 16 processors displayed.The Operator seems to work as required in VisIt 2.7.0 but not in VisIt 2.7.1.
So we suspect this may be related to the changes made to avtOnionPeelFilter.C at revisions 22330 and 22332 which follow on from Bug #1645

I have found an undesired behavior, causing the volume plot to fail when doing ray-casting
when variables names are compound names (i.e. /foo/bar/density), such as those read with netcdf, I can do a pseudocolor plot of the variable, and I can turn scale = log in the pseudocolor attributes
the error comes when switching to a volume plot (ray-casting), when switching the volumeplot attributes to data scale = log; it causes a failure because the variable's name gets truncated to its first string.
Example, read the aou.cdf from the netcdf_test_data examples.
the variable is available as ""aou"", or as ""as_zonal/aou"".
I can pseudocolor ""as_zonal/aou"" with or without log(), but doing a volume plot with scale = log results in a failure and the message:
viewer: An invalid variable (as_zonal) was specified.
here is the reproducer:

He has a dataset with 4 levels of subdivison and many timesteps.
When he changes timesteps, it looks like VisIt is getting confused regarding domain nesting and display coarser domains where it should be displaying finer ones. A re-open fixes. However, 'treat all databases as time varying' does not fix. Happens on 2.6.3 and 2.7.2.
He is giving me some data.

The following example which results the appended file ""sample.silo"" creates 2 polyhedral elements with different numbers of faces. If it is viewed in a Visit version newer than 2.5.2. all edges of the larger polyhedron are not displayed if one plots the mesh! Version 2.5.2. shows it correctly without any problems. Simply changing the ordering in the zonelist (first the small polyhedron, than the large polyhedron) ""fixes"" this problem, yet I do not know what is the ""correct"" ordering for larger examples! Sorting all polyhedrons by number of faces does not work in general (neither descending nor ascending).

Marty Marinak would like a way to group variables in the variable lists without changing the names of the variables. VisIt currently supports this with names that have paths. For example, if the variables are named ""a/b"", ""a/c"", then there would be an ""a"" entry with a sub list with ""b"" and ""c"". He has names in his files that other codes rely on so changing the names of the variables to exploit this would be a problem for him. He would like some other mechanism to do this.

In fixing #1789, I studied the code in vtkLinesFromOriginalCells.
It can wind up removing lines on the extreme edge of a mesh. The algorithm marches over cells and then edges for each cell. For each edge, it determines neighboring zones sharing the edge. For any edge for which two neighboring zones come from the same original mesh zone, the edge is removed. But, that logic removes edges that are on the extreme boundary of a mesh. I think the logic should be face based instead. For each cell, it should loop over the faces and for each face, over the edges and if an edge is found that is shared between faces that come from the same original mesh zone, then the edge should be removed.

In meeting with Kevin Durrenberger, it is becoming clear that the Mili plugin and Makemili support tool are in need of an overhaul for several reasons
	
mili data is not presented to Griz/Mili user's in a natural way
	
e.g. 'sanded' data should be automatically handled by the plugin and not exposed in the GUI as a subsetting option
using Mili in parallel VisIt causes rendering artifacts at domain boundaries due to lack of ghost-zones (need ucd mesh ghost-zone comm.)
free nodes was a one-off feature not part of Mili 'standard' use but is nonetheless 'in your face' in the GUI in any Mili file
We are not handling Mili 'materials' in the way that is most natural
We are probably very innefficient in PopMD in using Mili library

Sometimes I need to change the name of a variable that I'm exporting. Normally when I do this, I use expressions and do something like this:
rename = original_name
In the case of operator expressions, that expression would have to look like this (operator name can change):
rename = <operators/ConnectedComponents/Mesh>
When I plot the ""rename"" variable, VisIt does not like it and it will not plot the variable. So, I am not able to use the normal strategy to export.
If I export the original plot to Silo, the Silo writer will make an ""operators/ConnectedComponents/Mesh"" variable. When I read that file back into VisIt, it shadows the normal operator-created expression, which makes it unusable. That's the reason for wanting to rename but it did not work.
I think there is a separate ticket for renaming expressions on export without having to rely on expressions. That's what I would want here.

In several of our windows, we offer a text box that accepts a string like ""%g"" or ""%-8.4f"".
The assumption is that anyone using VisIt is famillar with printf-style format strings. Most are not.
We could 'fix' this in a few ways. One is to provide a link to some 'help' that explains to users unfamiliar with printf format strings how they work. The other is to give users a better interface with individual controls for total field width, precision, left/right adjustment within the field, to use + sign for positive numbers and whether to use exponentiation format, etc.
The latter solution, to have a better interface involves a lot more development time (perhaps Qt already has an interface though?) and so is more costly to do.

You can 'clear' picks but you cannot get it to start re-labeling them at 'a'.
I would think 'clearing' would also re-label them.
In any event, the CLI has a ResetPickLetter() command.

Info from Fred Morris
I still have the previously mentioned segfault. I have successfully compiled_simV2.so so that it is using the system Python; this has made no difference.
The segfault occurs in the same location regardless.
Below:
1) ldd output (showing linking against the system Python now).2) tail of the sim trace (trace.0.txt)3) tail of strace4) output of gdb bt after the segfault occurs
It occurs during the second call toVisItControlInterface_v2.c::VisItProcessEngineCommand
It occurs between the recvfrom and sendto system calls.
It occurs in SimulationCommand::SetCommand, and there's not much to that one:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Set property methods///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
voidSimulationCommand::SetCommand(const std::string &command_)
{    command = command_;    Select(ID_command, (void *)&command);}
Now what? I'd appreciate some help or I'm going to have to find some other way toinstrument what I'm working on. I'm o.k. with C, but C++ makes my head hurt. :-/

from Zhipeng Guo on the users list:
I think i found a solution for the problem. Normally i used the external surface operator to retrieve the surface of a volume, and after that i use the DeferExpression to do the Gauss curvature, the result is always positive, which is wired because for the configuration i used there should be somewhere the value is negative.   However, yesterday when i tried using the iso-surface operator to get the surface of the volume, and after that using the DeferExpression to do the Gauss curvature everything becomes accurate. The test cases i used includes a simple sphere and one that have concave surfaces. it is very easy to define and you can test it very easily. The dataset of mine is a bit large and i do not think i can send it to you via email.   The question is that why it doesn't work when i use the external surface operator? Is this operator doing extracting the surface of a volume? Or there must be some aspects that it differs from the iso-surface operator.
-- Cyrus' Note ---We should see if we can duplicate this with a simple spherical dataset (globe.silo?)  and create a test case that demonstrates this.

The latest versions of the nvidia drivers on the LC systems have been causing various rendering issues for us, most notably texture mapping is not working resulting in black boxes or missing text. The solution has been to back the nvidia driver back to version 3.0.4 on the login nodes, since this is typically where VisIt is run. Progress on getting the drivers fixed has been slow so Rich Cook has proposed adding the nvidia 304 open gl drivers to the VisIt lib directory as a solution.

This is a big annoyance for me on OS X.
When I am running VisIt, none of the pull down menus on the top menu bar have any items that are NOT grayed out if I do not have the main GUI panel 'active' (e.g. on the top).
So, getting to a menu item is a two step process; click somewhere harmless in the main GUI panel, then go to the top menu bar.
This is just another in a somewhat lengthy list of items where VisIt running on a Mac doesn't behave similarly to other mac-native software.

I was trying to test with libsim's updateplots example, which provides a 2D mesh and the simulation crashed when I attempted to plot the mesh. When I ran under a debugger, the Z coordinate field for the rectilinear grid was NULL when some code was trying to access it. It appears that recent changes to template the code via a macro have broken support for 2D. I connected successfully to the ""unstructured"" simulation and plotted its mesh. The mesh there is 3D. When I connected to another 2D simulation. ""material"", the same crash happened.

Scott Wilks had a 3d grid that is one zone thick. He wanted to collapse it to 2d and then revolve it. The project operator appeared to collapse it properly since it displayed as 2d. When he then applied the revolve operator it complained that the grid dimension had to less than or equal to 2. I exported the VTK file and looked at it and in the file was a 3d structured grid with the 2nd dimension as 2. So it was sorta 2d, but not really. Presumable that is why the revolve operator didn't like it.

From Rob Sisneros:(VisIt hanging on startup)
I just had this happen to me on my mac.  The only thing that had changed was that I had pinned the visit icon to my dock.  After removing from dock and starting visit from the launchpad it works again.  Im clueless.  Any mac experts out there who can shed some light on this?
--
With Rob's info about pinning to the dock -- I was able to recreate this:
1) Clicked on VisIt on my desktop (launchpad will also suffice)
The main VisIt app appears briefly, then the GUI pops up (the GUI is what remains in the dock)
2) Pin the ""VisIt GUI"" to the dock.
3) Close VisIt
4) Try to open via the pinned icon on the dock, the GUI hangs.
The problem is that when you pin to this dock this way, it is only the GUI component that is getting launched. The other parts of the puzzle aren't coordinated and the GUI hangs trying to connect to a non existent viewer. If you add VisIt to the dock by dragging the VisIt app over, then things work.
Not sure if there is a good way to resolve the pinning issue -- we would have to trick OSX into launching the correct script.

This was supposed to prevent bloat and speed up things, but I'm not sure it's still needed.If it is, we may not be using them correctly.  Not sure which metrics to use in determining if this code is still needed.
I ran across this while running Brad's simulation tests.
Test case simulation/mesh.py, does a 'disconnect' then attempts to 'connect' to the same simulation.In /src/sim/V2/runtime/VisItControlInterfaceRuntime.C  Burlen added a call to 'vtkVisItUtility::CleanupStaticVTKObjects' in order to clean up leaks.  I had to comment out this call in order to prevent a segv when running this simulation test.  The segv occurs during a call in avtGenericDatabase::GetMesh to vtkTrivialProducer::SetOutput.
Either our use of the trivial producer is incorrect, or the way we register/cleanup static objects is incorrect, or possibly both.
The only other time we call 'CleanupStaticVTKObjects' is when the Engine exits, and then only if DEBUG_MEMORY_LEAKS has been defined.  So I don't think it's ever been tested or possibly was never intended to be used on an active pipeline.

I cut-n-pasted a coordinate from a pick into the Lineout Query's End point text box. It included commas. But, hitting 'Query' button results in nothing happening and is confusing.
I think it would be best if it would just accept either a space ' ' or a comma ',' as a field separator.
In fact, that would be great if all of VisIt text box inputs behaved that way. We often present text to users (that they are inclined to cut-n-paste, which our text boxes cannot accept and that is probably a bad practice to continue). I would regard this later observation of VisIt handling of text outputs and inputs as a 'major irritation' though the particular case of this ticket is a minor one.

Reported by Jose M.
He is using Windows 7 and uses 'True X-Mouse Gizmo' to handle focus-follows-mouse policy on Windows 7. He claims there is no other way to enforce such a focus policy on Windows 7. Is he really right?
In any event, when True X-Mouse is running with VisIt, it appears to cause VisIt to create new viewer windows in response to several gestures such as changing time slider and scrolling plot list. Eventually, he has a slew of VisIt viewer windows up.
He tried running VisIt with True X-Mouse turned off and did not see the beavior.
I rank this as a low priority and think the real issue is finding the 'right' way for Jose to have focus-follows-mouse policy on windows.

There may be other places in VisIt where the special path is needed (code that calls avtCommonDataFunctions' GetDataRange??)

The basic problem is that the image does not look right when a Mesh plot is made transparent and there are other transparent plots in the picture. When the viewer renders such a scene in hardware, the transparent plots' alpha looks to be modified by the opacity of the lines, making opaque geometry under the lines show more brightly. When running in parallel on a multi-domain dataset, the problems are worse. In that case, various parts of the mesh lines are replaced with the background color. This probably has to do with how the domains are composited.
Transparency relies on the transparency actor for depth sorting. In parallel, the actor is also used to render transparent geometry in a second pass. I'm guessing that since the Mesh plot has its own renderer, and does not seem to make use of the transparency actor, that VisIt is not able to correctly render the transparent geometry in all of these cases. Results might be better if all the mesh lines were added into the transparency actor.
This looks really bad.
It might also be related to #1487.

This happend with a user who is building a new db plugin and started with the skeleton code.
If GetNTimesteps() returns a zero, the VisIt excepts with this funky error message

Tried to access an invalid index 1 (Maximum = 0).

For an STSD plugin, just running the skeleton results in a message of the ilk

VisIt opened the file successfully but there doesn't appear to be anything in the file to plot.

So, I think the bug is that for a 0 timesteps MTXX plugin, VisIt should report that same error.
I think there is logic in the FileFormatInterface classes that is through the exception before we can get to the logic that would produce the more useful error message. And, I guess I am saying that the logic that does that should be removed.

The attached script uses the Isosurface operator to generate a plot and then we then change the active plot variable and the the created geometry turns bad. Closing the compute engine and regenerating the plot causes the geometry to be correct.
I ran into a similar bug last fall that was caused by an old avtScalarTree being used when it should have been discarded because the data validity in the contract should have been invalidated. That bug was with the IndexSelect operator if I remember correctly. Since the symptoms are so similar, this is probably the same kind of thing.

Currently, when Ale3d runs in a multi-part mode that also works well with VisIt, you get a bazzillion files for all domains and all timesteps all in the same single directory. Ale3d currently does have a mode to run in where it puts each timestep in a separate directory like so
For restart files...
foo_128_00100
    foo_128_00100
    foo_128_00100.1
    .
    .
    .
and for plot files
foo_128.00100
    foo_128.00100
    foo_128.00100.1
    .
    .
    .

where the directory name is the same as the file containing all the multi-block objects (aka 'root' file). However, this mode doesn't work with VisIt for a couple of reasons. First, VisIt doesn't recognize a sequence of dirs in the filesystem as a time series. Second (which is a bit more of a stylistic issue) it requires the user to descend into a dir and find the root file before s/he can 'open' a timestep. So, this mode of Ale3d output is currently not friendly with VisIt.
Now, other codes have taken a slightly different approach to this problem by creating a master file (multi-block objects only) at the same level of the dir containing all the block files. But, this causes a time series in the filesystem to be seen as <master-file,dir> pairs and is stylistically unattractive to some users. There is a preference to have a point in the filesystem hierarchy that contains only a single entity (which would have*to*be a dir) for each timestep.
So, the problem is enhancing VisIt to treat this case (a series of dirs with 'root' files in the dirs of the same name as the dirs) properly. A key question is what this might mean for Visit's file browser GUI window. A double click on a dir in this context means to 'open' that dir and not to descend into it to browse its contents. We may need to affect some kind of preference or additional button in the file browser GUI to avoid constantly checking every dir we see for this 'special case' of a file by the same name within the dir but we may in fact be able to do that with minimal/trivial performance implications. An option is to before descending into a dir in the file browse window, check to see if there exists in the dir a file by the same name and then attempt to 'open' the dir as a timestep instead.
Some codes are switching to operate all-multi-part-all-the-time and so getting this in is crucial to supporting those codes.

It would be nice if Silo could portably determine the optimum number of file parts for a given dump.
The idea is that for a given MPI communicator, there is probably set number of I/O nodes the caller can actually see. Using more parts than than some multiple (maybe 1) of that number may not be too useful.

I'm not able to reliably make branches like I used to using the mk_branch_from_trunk script. I fired off the script a couple of hours ago and it has not come back indicating that the branch was created. I did the same yesterday and saw on anonymous svn that the branches were at least partially created. I don't think they got the branch to trunk revision number file though, which is critical for merge book-keeping.
The script should take a few minutes MAX.
Is this due to large amounts of data being copied? Or is it that the svn file system performance consistently sucks? I don't suspect the latter because a checkout of the trunk only takes a few minutes.

From Cihan Altinay:
Hi,
gcc 4.9 gives me a warning for line 1252 in tools/xdmf_writer/xdmf_writer.c
From my understanding the compiler is right as:
struct timeval times8;...int nBytes = 8 * sizeof(struct timeval);...for (i = 0; i < nBytes; i++)         allTimes[i] = times[i];...
so the loop should only go from 0 to 8 but it goes to nBytes which is8*sizeof(timeval)....
Cheers,Cihan

Hi Cihan,
Yes, that looks like a bug -- if we want to copy the bytes directly, we would need to use a different pointer type than timeval * (we could use char *)

Was working with large, 1Gigabyte, pvtu files.
Our VTK reader instantiates the whole file contents into memory and then, I think, hangs onto all of it.Reported by Ryan Vignes
When we read VTK, our reader instantiates the whole VTK object in the file into memory and everything in the file; every variable defined on the mesh. So, just reading the file to see what is in the file involves instantiating the whole 1Gigabyte object into memory. And, we do this on mdserver too!
For single part VTK files, Visit will use only one MPI task to process the data. Worse, however, is that it still winds up reading the file on all tasks!. So, for 16 processors, you don't get any speedup in terms of 16-way processing but you do wind up getting hit by a 16x memory consumption because the VTK file is istantiated into memory on every processor.
Doing a top while running on cab, I get the attached image for 16 processors and a single-part vtu file
Finally, if you'll notice in the attached 'top' image, one engine_par process is taking quite a bit more memory than the others. That is MPI rank 0, where all the work is actually being done by VisIt and I've moved forward several timesteps. And, there appears to be either a leak or some memory bloat we're not handling.

I tried the AMRStitchCell operator because I wanted to see if stitch cells could be used as a way to make a visualization that did not suffer from extra geometry at inter-level boundaries. I tried the operator with SAMRAI, Chombo, AMR file formats and for each dataset I tried, VisIt would give me some error suggesting that not enough data was present to make stitch cells. I could not find a dataset that was able to coax VisIt to make stitch cells.
Error messages:
SAMRAI:viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: Database plugin did not properly set level cell sizes using SetLevelCellSizes() method.ERROR: Mesh:  ()
Chombo:viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: Need structured domain boundaries to compute stitch cells.

This issue is done when the following are completed:
1. Document somewhere all extra information that a database reader needs to provide in order to produce stitch cells. Apparently, it needs at least base_index, SetLevelCells on the domain nesting data, and exactly 1 layer of ghost cells. That last one is a killer since VisIt ought to make the ghost cells if it does not have them.2. Fix SAMRAI, Chombo, Boxlib readers so they provide needed information.3. Ensure that StitchCells operator works with SAMRAI, Chombo, Boxlib test data and create test cases for nightly regression suite.4. Fix problem with the operator window when auto apply is enabled.

I tried looking for keywords like amr, ghost, interior, bound to see if there was an issue for this but I did not find anything.
When you have a 3D AMR mesh, VisIt does not remove all faces shared between patches at level boundaries. It looks like some amount of removal is done but much of the boundaries remain. This causes the plots to look bad when transparency is used (transparent Subset, transparent Pseudocolor).
This happens for a variety of AMR file formats and it suggests that VisIt's ghost zone generation is not quite producing enough ghost data to remove the interior faces at AMR level boundaries.
It may be that something like the AMRStitchCell operator eventually gets improved enough to be moved into VisIt's ghost zone generation routines.
Done:This issue is done when a set of different 3D rectilinear AMR datasets can be plotted using the Subset and Pseudocolor plots with transparency and have no inter-level interior geometry that fouls the look of the transparent plot (when looking at the entire dataset). VisIt must handle this automatically, with no special operators, etc. What is desired in that case is a transparent box that would match what would be plotted as when a single-domain rectilinear grid is plotted using transparency(see attached image that provides a mock-up). This will work in parallel too.

This code creates a DBmaterial object from scratch by adding all the members that are standard to a DBmaterial object. It also addes a number of custom members. On PDB driver, DBGetMaterial works and retrieves just the standard material object members. A DBGetObject call also works and retreives all members. On HDF5 driver, it does not work.
The reason is that HDF5 driver is smart about small arrays (for example, dims, or extents). The PDB driver just handles these as 'var' components inside the DBWriteComponent call writing tiny arrays to PDB. The HDF5 driver puts these in the object 'headers'. Thats fine. But, the implementation of DBWriteComponent in the HDF5 driver does the same thing as it does on the PDB driver, writing whatever it gets passed to HDF5 as a sep. array. Well, the problem happens when HDF5 tries to read the resulting object via a DBGetMaterial call. The object header is read as the 'silo' attribute but he 'dims' member of the memory representation and file representation differ significantly due to the way DBWriteComponent handle it on the customized material object. The result is that H5Aread cannot handle data conversion (between a mem rep. of int3 and a file rep of char*) and so fails to read the object header.
The solution is for HDF5's implementation of DBWriteComponent to not write these tiny arrays and treat them as 'var' component. But, the data has to get stored somewhere until the object is written with DBWriteObject. The solution is to add a buffer to a DBobject where HDF5 driver can store these tiny arrays and then during DBWriteObject call, construct the memory representation as appropriate before writing to the file. This occurs for all MEMBER_3() arrays in HDF5 driver.

The XDMF reader is unable to use more than 1000 files in a time series. This is likely a limit on open file descriptors in the XDMF reader. This report was made at the visitusers.org forum:
I use VisIt to visualize the outputs of my pflotran simulations which are in XDMF-format. I realized that Visit would not accept more than one thousand xml-files at the time , otherwise it gives me the error message quoted below.
The obvious workaround has been to sort my output into folders containing < 1000 files each and open them one at the time. This is tedious though, so I wonder if anyone has run onto a similar problem or has a solution to force visit to accept a larger number of input files.
Quote:VisIt could not read from the file ""/****/pflotran-*.xmf database"".
The generated error message was:
There was an error opening /****/pflotran-*.xmf database. It may be an invalid file.VisIt tried using the following file format readers to open the file: Xdmf, Silo
If you know the specific format reader VisIt should use toread this data, you can use Open As... (GUI) or'-o <file>,<plugin> (CL arg.) and identify that specific readerfor VisIt to try. This will possibly give more information onthe exact error.

the databases diff.py test is skipped everywhere. It needs to be updated to work with newer testsuite, and or dependency scripts moved into cli. See the following conversation from VisIt Developers list:
Hi  Burlen,
It runs visit in -diff mode & relies on some paths that wouldnt work for out of source builds.
Because it was an odd test --  when I switched the test suite to python it didnt fully survive. I am sure we could resurrect it.
However, the -diff mode really just leverages a fancy python script.  I have long felt we should support what it does as part of the main visit python module.

I have an AMR data set with a single level. The data is zonal. When re-centered to be nodal via the expression operator the results appear to the be correct. However, if one then does an iso-surface operation the results are wrong.
I exported this same data set an as a VTK dataset and re-read it in and was able to successfully iso-surface the data.

It would appear that FixWraparounds located in  avtCoordSystemConvert.C does a conversion of VTK_POLY_DATA to a VTK_UNSTRUCTURED_GRID. Which is not correct in two ways. The conversion does not keep any of the lines. So all geometry is lost.  Points are passed through. But further transform should not be returning VTK_UNSTRUCTURED_GRID but another VTK_POLY_DATA.
This problem occurs in the case of integral curves operator that returns a VTK_POLY_DATA structure that contains only lines.
I am not quite sure that should happen as for now I have a check that by-passes this conversion if a VTK_POLY_DATA is encountered that contains only line.
This can be recreated by creating integral curves and doing a conversion from cartesian to cylindrical coordinates (would deed to remove my check).

The cli was linking with manta, which caused a strange issue:

visit -nowin -cli -s script.pyI attach a stripped down version of the script (using a single file instead of extracting a new silo file at each loop iteration and not setting any plot options) which still went down from 20 pngs/min to 3/min output speed in 2 hours before I stopped it.

The only user workaround for that is to periodically close the compute engine and start it up again via scripting. However, that should not be necessary as the leak should not exist.
To fix problems like this, it would be helpful to know the version/platform of VisIt being used and for you to share a version of your script that reproduces the problem.Brad

once more I am availing myself of the listss excellent know-how to solve the following problem: I am running pretty complex pythons scripts in Visit to visualize large data sets. The sets contain about 300 data files (NetCDF) each and  process about 5 runs in parallel. This means, that I have bash scripts that start 5 instances of Visit from the command line, each with a script.
I observe, that the processing time per data set is a function resembling a 1-exp(x) function. At first the processing goes reasonably fast (5-10 seconds), but very soon the performance starts to sag. In end end, it takes about 30 mins to 1 hour to process one file. I am taking care to close all databases I open and Im reasonably sure the python code does not produce any memory leaks.
Perhaps I am going on about the problem in the wrong way. Any ideas on how to improve my predicament?

Connecting to a running simulation using Libsim with auto-update enabled, I can add plots but I can't change the settings the plots or their underlying operators like slices, because when VisIt is alerted of a new time-slice being completed, it resets the settings UI - even for plots that are not yet drawn! The behaviour makes some sense for plots that are actually being drawn every time slice, but having the option to properly configure a new plot before drawing without getting interrupted by the time slices would make a lot more sense, regardless of whether the simulation is running and auto-updating or not.
Of course, this can be circumvented by halting the simulation, plotting and then starting the simulation again, but it feels rather tedious and un-intuitive.

I'm not using stdin/sockets instead passing -1 to VisItDetectInput, and I'm only using the custom UI using my own .ui-file. Though binding VisItUI_clicked should be enough on its own, to trigger the events, I need to create a ""dummy"" of ControlCommandCallback, for example as follows:

void ControlCommandCallback(const char *cmd, const char *args, void *cbdata)
{
    simulation_data *sim = (simulation_data *)cbdata;
}

/* Later setting callback... */
VisItSetCommandCallback(ControlCommandCallback, (void*)&sim);

So, by commenting out VisItSetCommandCallback, VisItUI_clicked-callbacks no longer work. Not knowing this makes debugging time consuming, and it doesn't make sense to a regular developer.

These Silo files should have a flag to force us to effectively TreatAllDBsAsTimeVarying, but we are hitting some corner case. (I can't verify this easily b/c I can't seem to run silo's browser tool on the machine where this dataset lives)

Be sure to see Wiki article, 32 and 64 bit indexing in Silo
Jeff Grandy requested a look at this issue. He anticipates this for large, shared memory systems. He calculates that if type int is used for things like material lists, zonelists, etc., the maximum number of elements in a single mesh block is 250 million. I agree. Here's his arithmetic
Consider a ucd mesh of hexes. The zonelist is an array numElems * 8. If max integer value is 2^31-1, the longest the zonelist can be is about 2 billion integers meaning about 250 million hex zones.
Jeff would like to consider options for switching to a 64-bit integral type (int64_t, long or long long) where appropriate.
Everywhere in Silo where we use integer arrays to refer to nodes or zones, Matlist, Matspecies, Facelist, Edgelist, Zonelist, PHZonelist, Groupel maps would have to be adjusted to deal with this.
We'd do it only on the HDF5 driver, not PDB driver.
One simple option is to provide a compile-time switch to compile Silo's interface both ways. That make be workable. However, providing a run-time ability to specify either 32-bit or 64-bit values may be a bit more involved.
A subsequent question is whether VisIt can digest this too.

Be sure to see Wiki article, 32 and 64 bit indexing in Silo
Jeff Grandy requested an examination of this issue. He is considering supporting 64 bit node/zone ids in things like material lists, zonelists, polyhedral zonelists, etc.
Currently, VTK uses the type vtkIdType for this. However, it is also typedef'd to be an int.
Also, VisIt takes an automatic 2x memory hit if all of the suddent we switched to handling all this as 64-bit. Thats worse if most of the time, we never actually need the extra size. Certainly, during problem-sized I/O operations, if we read 64-bit data, we can discover if its actually even needed and if not, convert it to 32-bit data.
However, what happens if we read 64-bit data and actually need that number of bits for the ucd zonelist? On a large shared memory system, it might be possible for us to decompose a large block (one requiring 64-bit ids) on the fly into smaller blocks such that no block actually needs 64-bit and then process it in parallel (perhaps with threads) instead.

It's common for apps on OS X to be installed only by dragging the app to the Applications folder, but VisIt wants to be in the PATH as well (for visit -env calls with Libsim I suspect). I suggest checking if VisIt is in the PATH on the first startup, and if not, the user would be prompted, asking if she would like it added. This is particularly important with Libsim, where connecting to a simulation without adding VisIt to the path first will just cause it to fail (VisIt did not connect: Failed to open the VisIt library: (null)). This is tested and verified on 2.7.3 and a 2.8.0b trunk snapshot from yesterday running on OS X 10.9.4.
Personally I just added VisIt to /etc/paths, but it may not need to be that invasive, likely using bash_profile will work as well, on a user-level instead of globally.
These seemingly small things can take quite a while to figure out for an uninitiated developer (took me a little while), as the error doesn't exactly say ""go add VisIt to your path!"" but rather something obscure you can't make out the reason of.

reading the arrays holding sideset data and then 'painting' a binary field onto the mesh where it is a 1 for those nodes that are touched by sides in the sideset.

I was doing some tests with PickByZone, comparing the returned 'point' with the results of a ZoneCenter query on the same zone (they should be equivalent).  I discovered some oddities with curv2d, in that Pick will return different center than ZoneCenter, but even worse, OnionPeel will highlight a completely different cell. (I often use OnionPeel in conjunction with Pick as a sanity check.)
Here's a small script:
OpenDatabase(silo_data_path(""curv2d.silo""))
AddPlot(""Mesh"", ""curvmesh2d"")
AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""d"")
DrawPlots()
#do a pick before Onion peel
p1 = PickByZone(482)
#Add Onion peel of same zone, see if it ends up under the pick letter
AddOperator(""OnionPeel"")
op = OnionPeelAttributes()
op.index = 482
SetOperatorOptions(op)
DrawPlots()

#Now dd a boundary plot, do the same pick, see if get same results.
AddPlot(""Boundary"", ""mat1"")
DrawPlots()
p2 = PickByZone(482)
if p2['point'] == p1['point']:
    print(""PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots yielded same point"")
else:
    print(""PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots DID NOT yield same point"")
SetQueryOutputToObject()
q = Query(""Zone Center"", element=482)
if (q['center'] == p1['point']):
    print ""ZoneCenter query returned same coords as Pick"" 
else:
    print ""ZoneCenter query returned different coords than Pick"" 

#Now feed the zone center as coordinates into a pick:
p3 = ZonePick(coord = q['center'])
print ""Pick using coord from Zone Center query returned zone: "", p3['zone_id']

Here's the results:PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots yielded same pointZoneCenter query returned different coords than PickPick using coord from Zone Center query returned zone:  513
Now, if you Make the OnionPeel'd Pseudocolor plot active, and use the mouse to Pick on that zone, Pick will return zone '585'.But we told OnionPeel to use zone '482'.
I think the difference is in the handling of ghosts, more specifically the 'AVT_HAS_GHOSTS' ghostType.

Using --parallel with OpenMPI, the build script successfully locates mpicc and writes the following to the site config:

##
## Parallel Build Setup.
##
VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT(VISIT_PARALLEL ON TYPE BOOL)
## (configured w/ mpi compiler wrapper)
VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT(VISIT_MPI_COMPILER /usr/local/bin/mpicc TYPE FILEPATH)

The build passes, but crashes at runtime with OpenMPI, despite compiled with OpenMPI wrappers using --parallel. This issue is described in ParallelPorting on the Wiki, but is kind of confusing given the automatic option --parallel.
For me it takes quite a while to build VisIt on my local machine (even longer for the cluster), and it would have saved me a lot of time both compiling (once instead of twice) and investigating, if the build_script checked if I had OpenMPI and added the following missing lines to begin with:

VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT(VISIT_MPI_C_FLAGS ""-DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX"")
VISIT_OPTION_DEFAULT(VISIT_MPI_CXX_FLAGS ""-DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX"")

OpenMPI comes with the ompi_info utility, stored in the same directory as mpicc (seemingly by convention, confirmed both on Mac and Linux), which could be used as one indicator of whether the MPI setup warrants the additional lines in the cmake site configuration. By using the same path as the current mpicc, it would also be more likely that the existence of the ompi_util is not a false positive, found elsewhere but not related to the active mpicc.
It might be nasty of me to call this a bug, but I believe some simple heuristics in the build script could save many of us mere mortals a lot of time in the future.

USING GetPlotTypeName() OFTEN MEANS YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING BAD! FOR EXAMPLE, DON'T USE IT TO COMPARE THE PLOT NAME AGAINST THE NAME OF A PLUGIN SUCH AS ""Lineout"". INSTEAD, CONSIDER EXTENDING THE VIEWER PLUGIN INTERFACE.

This method is used extensively, and floods the viewer log files for the simplest things.
Not sure why this message is needed.  Is this truly a bad method?  If so, then let's remove it and extend the plugin interface as suggested.  Or is it only bad in certain use-cases.  If so, we should identify those and make modifications, and remove this message.
In ViewerPlot.C this method is used to set the actor's type name (is that bad?).  It is also called when clearing the actors, to print the plot name in debug logs.
ViewerPlotList uses it.
ViwerQueryManager uses it.  Is that the 'bad' use cases mentioned in the message?

Although we add pick letters engineering folks (Mili users) have inquired regarding possibility of highlighting picked node or zone.
In theory, the process could be much the same as doing the pick letter except that the pick attributes wind up returing a center/radius (for a picked node to highlight) or a set of points and line segments between then, to serve as the highlighted edges of the picked zone.

It would be nice of unstructured meshes could support a single geometry.
We use tetrahedral meshes (only tetrahedral), thus we store our data as such:Vertices: {x,y,z,x,y,z,...}Tetrahedrons/connections: {v1,v2,v3,v4,v1,v2,v3,v4,...}
VisIt wants VISIT_CELL_TET for every set of four tetrahedrons causing either an overhead of N/4 elements.
There are two options to get around this:- What we currently do: copy the connections and att VISIT_CELL_TET where needed (introduces a memory overhead)- Modify our internal representation of the connections to fit VisIt (would make our simulation code platform-dependent and introduces a slight memory overhead)
My guess is that meshes of mixed geometries are far more rare than meshes of only one geometry.
The ideal solution would allow for both mixed geometries and passing a list (such as our list of connections described above) and a single VISIT_CELL_TET passed in a separate variable, which would solve the issues with both options above.
As Brad Whitlock suggests, doing this internally might be a solution, but it would also mask the overhead to the end user. Another option, if possible, would be to implement this in VisIt as well, to truly allow for the connectivity to be passed without memory overhead.

There are at least two places that handle !KEYWORD logic from .visit files; avtDatabase::GetFileListFromTextFile and avtDatabaseFactory::FileList.
The number of keywords has grown overtime to include !NBLOCKS, !TIME and !ENSEMBLE. It could grow again.
Since GetFileListFromTextFile presumably returns only the list of files within the text file, it can do all the magic of finding these keywords and pull them out/apart from the rest of the file list.
However, right now, FileList assumes GetFileListFromText file does not remove any of the special keywords in the list. So, you wind up passing this list of strings around called a file list that really contains also these special keyword strings (as ascii strings) that winds up having to get strtol or strtod processed in multiple places.
OTOH, if GetFileListFromText file pulls the special keyword strings out of the list of strings, then there is going to have to be a separate way to pass what it finds to FileList. I would opt to use a std::map&lt;string, double&gt; keywords assuming all integral values we'll need to handle this way are small enough to fit, without loss, into a double.
I started making this revision but as I got into it I realized that !TIME may be able to occur more than once in the file and decided I didn't want to make such a change this close to the release.

Users try to record a setup using a data binning, they are doomed.

SetOperatorOptions(DataBinningAtts) DrawPlots()

I get the error: viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: The minimum for the range of a variablemust be less than the maximum
This case is also due to win vs nowin (with win knowing more about the extents of the y var?)

A single window mode would be very nice. Although it's not a visualization tool Photoshop could serve as a very neat example, with its dark shading also being very easy on the eyes. GIMP has followed suit and among other image processing tools like Pixelmator it's one of the most requested features.
If several plots are visualized, a tabbed view could be used, rather than keeping multiple windows open. This would also make window handling easier and more consistent across platforms, avoiding bugs like http://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1840.

I believe our support of aribtrary polyhedral data consists of readers that support it doing their own splitting, passing the split cells down through the pipeline, and also creating avtOriginalCellNumbers as an aid for the rest of the pipeline.I recently added a 'zonesWereSplit' flag to avtMeshMetaData as an indicator in the pipeline that the reader did the cell splitting (as opposed to an operator that splits cells).
I think we need a better, more consistent way to handle arbitrary polyhedral data.


Couple of thoughts:
	
VTK supports arbitrary polyhedra via VTK_POLYHEDRON cell type (also supports all kinds of QUADRATIC cell types)
A pipeline contract field could be added so that filters can state where or not they can handle arb poly cell types
Splitting of arb poly cells can be done in a single place (like transform manager) when a given pipeline cannot handle the cell type natively
May need a new method of notifying pipeline filters (or queries) that the original data was arb poly in nature.
VTK has a mechanism for passing 'information' along with a vtkDataSet. This may be useful, but may not be as visible in nature as adding new fields to our pipeline objects (avtDataAttributes, avtDataValidity, etc.) Vs reader sends a vtkInformation object for use by avtStaggeringFilter, as an example.



Some notes on what I found while trying to fix an issue with arb-poly mesh plots in conjunction with OnionPeel:
	
The data was Silo
Silo reader created avtOriginalCellNumbers (good)
avtFacelistFilter created an avt3DCellNumbers array (this isn't related to arb-poly that I can tell).
vtkLinesFromOriginalCells (used by avtMeshFilter) utilized the avt3DCellNumbers array to determine if edges should be kept or not.
In the use-case of arb-poly data, the avt3DCellNumbers array was incorrect imho, as it treated each 'split' cell as unique. If Silo reader provided this array in the arb-poly case instead of avtFacelistFilter, then perhaps the Mesh plot would be a bit more accurate. 
I added a 'zonesWereSplit' field to avtMeshMetaData to inform the pipeline that the database reader did cell splitting (as opposed to operators that may split zones).  This has the potential to be misunderstood or misused, and should probably be rethought.

Hello,
Are there still known issues with the Exodus reader in versions 2.7.x and later?  I saw discussion earlier this summer about an updated Exodus reader plugin, but I am still seeing issues, and some of my collaborators at ARL are also having issues:
1  Parallel Exodus files are not being loaded correctly in version 2.7.x and 2.8.  For some reason these newer versions of VisIt seem to be stacking the processor files serially, so that only the first of a set of parallelized files are actually being read in and plotted.  (v2.6.2 is still OK)
2  Automatic file format recognition doesnt work for parallel Exodus files  has never worked.  User must select Exodus manually.
3  The Boundary and Filled Boundary plot types dont work for some reason.  Perhaps materials or material volume fractions are not being recognized?  This also has never worked.
4  Materials are not being recognized for turning on and off of subsets in a figure.  (May be related to 3 above.)

Hi Eric and John,
Thank you very much for spending so much time on this, and sorry for these strange legacy conventions. One of the many things on the to do list is to make this more sane.
This mismatch can happen because BOUT++ adds guard cells in y for imposing boundary conditions. If a user collects all the data including guard cells (which is the default) then the output array will be larger than the input grid. The number of extra points will vary depending on the number of guard cells needed, which depends on the numerical schemes used. The number of extra points in y should always be even though: the same number added to each end.
I recommend checking if the y dimensions are consistent. If not, check that the solution file dimensions are larger than the grid file dimensions, and that the number of extra points is even. If not even then raise an error; if even then remove the same number of points from each side of the solution array.
Ixseps1 and ixseps2 determine the locations in x of the branch cuts, and are the number of grid points inside each of the two possible cuts. They can be set to zero or a negative number to mean that all points are outside the cut (and so non periodic), or a large number (which might be bigger than the number of grid points) to mean that all points are inside the cut (and so periodic). Zperiod should have a lower bound of 1, but an upper bound is tricky. Once it gets to around 50 you might want to print a warning, as it's unlikely to be physical. Not impossible though.
Thanks again

The avtMeshMetaData object has cellOrigin, blockOrigin, groupOrigin and nodeOrigin.
In Silo, a DBucdmesh object has a origin member which presumably is the origin for nodes (Silo header file and documentation says that this member can be either 0 or 1). A DBzonelist object also has an origin member, presumably the origin for zones (also either a 0 or a 1).
In Silo plugin, we use the origin member of the DBucdmesh object to set cellOrigin of avtMeshMetaData object. Thats wrong. It should use the origin member of the DBzonelist object to set cell origin.
There are potentially two things we are trying to achieve with an origin setting in Silo. One is to let readers of index arrays (like a zonelist) know that the numbers in the zonelist start from one (a fortran data producer) rather than zero (a C data producer). The other is to let a visualization tool like VisIt know where to start numbering things at. Note that the later interpretation is a bit less general than the idea of global node numbers because it only permits numbers to be offset by some constant.
What does Silo's origin member in a DBucdmesh object really mean?

I've attached a silo file. Its 1024 blocks of 8x8 quadmeshes. It takes a long to just to open in VisIt and then a rediculously long time to plot anything. And, even after the first plot, the next plot takes just as long. Try mesh plot and then try subset plot. Both go through a calc external facelist step (deduced via watching Compute Engine dialog) that takes a very long time (more than a minute) on my Mac on one processor. On more processors, of course it goes faster. But, still way too slow given the size of the dataset. And, not sure why this step is even necessary in 2D
I rated as rare because this particular granularity of mesh blocks is not all that common.

After revolving a 2d RZ problem to 3D, the 2D labels remained attached to the x+y axes. This is actually inconsistent with the output coord system.
To resolve this we should always label the axis in the new coord system correctly.

One of the CDash builds has revealed warnings where the MPI type used in an MPI call does not match the passed-in buffer type. For example, avtCompactnessQuery contains some code where there is MPI_Bcast that is using MPI_FLOAT but the buffer was changed to double instead of float. That example needs to be changed to MPI_DOUBLE in the MPI call. This must be bad at runtime.
This build uses clang and flags several of these errors. Building with clang might be enough to flag all of these problems.

On Mac, the Spreadsheet plot shows a single slice through the data instead of creating many tabs. This was originally for efficiency reasons. Now, it seems that when you plot a 3D dataset and use the slice slider in the Spreadsheet viewer to go to a new slice value, the main spreadsheet tab does not update with new values.

Mostly I see this happen to viewer upon normal exit. Symptoms are variable.
Sometimes, all that happens is the shell command prompt from the window in which VisIt was launched never returns.
Sometimes, you get some kind of an error message on the terminal from which VisIt was launched indicating an error.
Sometimes, there is no indication anything went wrong and you have to examine process table manually using ps to discover a VisIt process is left around.
Mostly its the viewer. Sometimes I've seen the mdserver.
I tried several times to reproduce using serial visit. After 6 attempts, I tried running a parallel VisIt and after 2-3 attempts, I was able to get a hang.
I managed to catch a snapshot of the problem and in this case, the viewer was here in RemoteProcess.C on line 157.
It looks like this code was recently changed too and so I suspect it is the culprit..

Valgrind doesn't do so well checking memrory errors for stack allocated objects.
I've encountered a nasty FPE in VisIt that is the result of a memory overrun of a 6-item array of doubles for bounds. Haven't found the cause yet.
In any event, it makes me think we should also try to run VisIt through gcc's mudflap tool and/or the SafeCode tool (a big clang add-on).

While resolving some FPEs in VisIt, I happend to encounter a couple of classes in avt/IVP which have a lot of data members that don't appear in the constructor. As an example, I hacked avtPICSFilter.C constructor and turned the body of the constructor into an initializer list. Its an easy transformation of the code. Then, I compiled with -WeffC++. That switch warns about data members that DO NOT appear in the initializer list. It generates the warnings beloiw. I briefly checked a couple of the member names here and indeed they don't appear in avtPICSFilter's constructor. I think there are other classes there that may have similar issue.

2011,Pending,Bug,Normal, audit leakage of FLT_MAX/DBL_MAX outside methods where they are needed ,-,-,-,Mark Miller,10/03/2014,,0%,,10/03/2014 05:34 pm,10/13/2014 12:54 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,2.7.3,,,All,Any,"
In numerous places in Visit, often to initialize some min/max values, that iterate over data values, we us the constants FLT_MAX/DBL_MAX.
That is fine for the methods in which they are initially assigned and used. However, in many cases, those values wind up leaking out and getting returned to callers which may not have been designed to cope with them. And, the result is increased potential for hard to diagnose FPEs.
We need to make a pass over the code and ensure that wherever FLT_MAX/DBL_MAX are introduced as an initializer of some kind, we don't permit such data to leak out to callers.

The find module does not take into account whether or not Visus was actually requested.It isn't currently used on Windows, and I still get 'ERROR Visus library not found on the system.'
Other libraries issue the more appropriate 'not requested' message.  This message is generated by most of our Find modules when they call the 'SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY' macro.
FindVisus doesn't use this macro, but should have logic for determining if the user even requested that the Visus library be used.At any rate, unless one specifically needs the Visus reader, then not finding the Visus library should not be an ERROR, as it leads to confusion.

We have some test data (curv2d.silo, rect2d.silo, curv3d.silo, rect3d.silo and other variants created by exporting from VisIt into other formats) where a vector 'vel' has constant magnitude.
The challenge in using this data in the vector plot in test outputs in VisIt is that its too susceptible to changes in order of operations causing huge variations in coloration of the plot.
I propose we root out all the cases where this vector data has been created/copied in our test data and then adjust it to be non-constant magnitude and then re-baseline all the tests involving it.
Another way of (not) handling this is to simply clamp the color range of the legend used in the py test files to a slightly wider range.

When we have data that is almost constant value to within a digit of machine precision, and when that data is the result of computational operations in VisIt (e.g. expressions or what not), then as VisIt source code is changed, the data can change in ways that results in dramatic variation in coloring of plots.
It would be best if VisIt has some tolerance for this so that, internally, it could detect when this is happening and then pass that information around to parts of VisIt that could usefully respond. For example, if the mappers and legend are aware that even though min-max is non-zero it is so close to zero that it might as well be zero would be useful.
Also, the user might like a preference to disable the new default behavior proposed here.

2017,Resolved,Bug,High, viewercore introduces _ser library dependencies into simV2runtime_par. ,Brad Whitlock,-,2.11.0,Brad Whitlock,10/09/2014,,100%,,10/09/2014 03:40 pm,06/28/2016 03:37 pm,3 - Occasional,3 - Major Irritation,2.7.3,,,All,Any,"
The viewercore library contains the core parts of the viewer and it is used to add viewer functionality to libsim. Since viewercore relies on some AVT stuff and was destined for the viewer, it ends up linking with some _ser avt libraries. When viewercore is linked into the parallel simV2runtime_par library, it brings along its _ser dependencies, even though we really want only the _par versions of the avt libraries.
The best thing might be to build the viewercore sources directly into the simV2runtime libraries instead of linking with viewercore. This would permit us to use the _ser and _par libraries that we want explicitly. We could also omit files like ViewerFileServer and ViewerEngineManager, which are not needed by the simV2runtime, and have some _ser dependencies of their own due to libraries like engineproxy. Furthermore, by not using some of those classes, we could revert to not building libraries like mdserverrpc, mdserverproxy, launcherrpc, launcherproxy, when we're doing engine-only builds.
As things stand on the trunk, engine-only builds are broken because the simv2 runtimes can't be linked with viewercore, which is not built.

This function tries to embue a zonelist with shapetype information when it is not present.
The only case thats ambiguous is a zonelist for which topological dimension is not specified and contains only shapes of size 4. It could be a mesh of tets or a mesh of quads. But, any mesh with a mix of shape sizes, we can make a good guess. If the mix is all shape sizes of 3 and 4, 3's can only be 2D triangles and so more than likely the 4s are quads. If the mix is sizes of 4 and 5, 6 and/or 8, those shapes can only be 3D shapes and so more than likely the 4s are tets.
The logic in silo doesn't exploit this kind of information and expects there to be a topological dimension information to inform it how to interpret shapes of size 4.

The images in VisIt's gallery appear to have quality issues

So, some of this is inside the VisIt page tree. Some of it is outside in the broader WCI set of pages. But, because of its relationship with visualization or proximity to VisIt pages is probably something we need to take ownership of, review and where appropriate, advocate to get fixed.

I was having some problems with paraDIS plugin.
Because mdserver was presenting correct menus, I tried to add a plot. It failed.
I happened to turn my attention to something else on my system and left VisIt session running. Then, I noticed about every 3-5 mins, the VisIt error dialog would chime and come to front and display the same information. This happend several times in the same of 10 minutes. . .

We have a non-default operator to do a Dulauney triangulation of a set of points. It works for small numbers of points but takes forever on a dataset consisting of 700,000 points.

I happened to be running -np 4 on my laptop.
I was looking at a tecplot dataset of 700,000 points. But, it was just a single block dataset.
It works fine. But, I tried Dulauney triangulation on it and observed some very bad parallel behavior.
All 4 processors were spinning at 100%. Only one however was doing any work because it was only a single block dataset. Why?
All the other processors had entered their 'sync' phase and were waiting in an MPI_SendRecv operation and that operation is spinning the processors at 100%.
We had a similar issue with an idle engine waiting in an MPI_Reduce operator in the main even loop for input from the user and resolved it by writing our own MPI_Reduce.
I suspect we need same for MPI_SendRecv in this case. Does MPI-3 fix this kind of thing?

Patrick Brantley had a CSG mesh with approximately 36,000 spheres, where each sphere was a CSG region. When VisIt tried to discretize the mesh, it would crash regardless of the discretization method. I found that I could only discretize about 3500 spheres with a smallest cell size set to 0.2. It only created 8 of the 3500 spheres so geometry was not an issue, but it the SZ was about 28Gb and the RSS was about 8Gb. It turns out each region creates a vtkDataSet that gets cached multiple times even if the data sets contain no zones. We should either have those vtkDataSets be null or point to a global null data set (note this may have threading implications). I created a work around for Patrick by creating a program to merge the spheres into a smaller number of regions, each with many spheres. VisIt was able to handle this fine.

This happens on my Mac laptop.
Start VisIt, open some file. Any file will do. Just get the GUI menus populated.
Go to Plots->Pseudocololor. The submenu of available variables appears. Be still for just a moment. The submenu goes away.
Now, if you hold the mouse very still immediately upon entering the Pseudocolor option in the parent '''before''' the submenu materializes '''and then''' you hold the mouse perfectly still, once it materializes, it will '''not''' disappear.
Very strange. I promise I am not going crazy. Cyrus can vouch for me 'cause I should it to him.
It has happened in every version of VisIt I have built on my Mac. Maybe its my build of Qt?
I listed as a major irritation because it often prevents me from navigating menus easily.

I did a lineout with a line that didn't intersect the mesh and got the following error message:
ERROR: Curve: ()viewer: No input was defined for this filter.
This isn't the greatest error message and should probably be improved. Now each time I create a new lineout I get the same error message. I did notice that I had a line in the plot list for the window with the lineouts that was red for my line that didn't intersect the mesh. Perhaps that is causing the problem. That probably shouldn't be there, but I guess someone might want to do that if the mesh moved and was doing a time animation. I suspect that would have other problems as well.

This is Mac specific. But, I think its a common enough mistake we should probably defend against it.

Go to visit.llnl.gov. Download a version of VisIt with Safari (or some other browser)
Open it and mount the dmg file so it creates the little disk icon on your desktop.
Ok, now do it all a second time.
Now, double click on the VisIt icon for the 2nd instance you've created.

It fails silently. If you run from command line, you get

python: can't open file '/frontendlauncher.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Whats happening is that the 2nd download has caused the Mac to append a "" 1"" (that is a space character followed by a number 1) to the mount point. And, that causes frontendlauncher all sorts of troubles.

Not sure if we already have such a beast or whether it'd be useful. I spend a lot of time deleting VisIt developer emails though.
Would like to have a discussion about having a VisIt chat room as opposed to using emails for everything VisIt developer related.


Here are some feature thoughts. . .
	
Would be neat if could send an email to visit-developers and include a 'lets chat about this' link that would allow the discussion to easily continue as a 'chat' taking it out of email land and reducing email load on everyone except those actually involved in the conversation.
content should be saved/archived/searchable or at least have a way to save some window/thread of dialog
shouldn't require a lot of overhead to create accounts for people
maybe ok if we started with just LLNL developers before expanding

There appears to be a chat plugin for redmine but its was last updated over 4 years ago.
Google has a free chat service too that is saveable/searchable

2057,Resolved,Bug,Normal, VTU reader no longer tolerates duplicated vertices ,Kathleen Biagas,-,2.9,Wolfgang Bangerth,11/10/2014,,0%,,11/10/2014 05:35 pm,12/22/2014 03:24 pm,3 - Occasional,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,2.8.0,,,All,Any,"
In the deal.II library (http://www.dealii.org), we frequently output data fields of which some are continuous and some are not. We do this by duplicating every vertex as many times as there are adjacent cells and simply outputting everything as if they were discontinuous fields. This used to work with the VTU reader up to VisIt 2.7.x but is apparently broken in 2.8.x. For example, the attached file simply consists of four squares with values 0...3 but it leads to the following error upon displaying the ""solution"" variable:
The compute engine running on host down.math.tamu.edu issued the following warning: In domain 0, your nodal variable ""solution"" has 16 values, but it should have 9.  Some values were removed to ensure VisIt runs smoothly.
Not surprisingly, the output after removing nodal values is wrong as can be seen by comparing with the output produced by 2.7.x. Curiously, the same problem does not seem to happen with the corresponding VTK file (also attached).
Severity: Affects those among the several hundred deal.II users that use VisIt (~50%).

There is bug data for this bug in /usr/gapps/visit/bug_data on RZ
There is a session file too.

Open the database
plot a mesh plot of 'mesh'
plot a pc plot of 'hflux_error_norm'
draw
move to timestep 2 (probably not relevant)
Add threshold operator (ensure apply operator to all plots is enabled)
hit draw and you get a segv'd engine

Now, you should get an error message that it cannot apply threshold to 'mesh' plot and that is a correct error message.
But, the engine shouldn't segv.

A while back I added logic to VTK plugin to remove duplicate nodes from any ucd mesh in which every zone has its own unique nodes. That was hackish to work around an issue with CharlesX output format.
I didn't think anyone would actually want duplicate nodes.
Turns out at least one customer wants duplicate nodes to handle discontinuous nodal fields.
Whats the right answer here. Allowing duplicate nodes for purposes of discontinuous nodal fields is a huge overkill and hurts VisIt performance internally immensely. It would be better if we allowed for discontinuous nodal fields. We could do this implicitly by adjusting logic checking for mesh node count and variable tuple counts and if they are not equal but the field's count is such that it is indicate of having a value as though each cell has its own unique (duplicate) nodes, then we can handle and render it as a discontinuous field.
Or, we can consider a different type of centering AVT_NODE_CENT_DISCONTINUOUS.
Or, we can add a feature to avtVarMetadata.

There is no easy way to restore an individual plot/operator attributes back to its factory setting after someone has changed it, hit make default and then saved settings. No one has requested this. However, I did recently help a user with with these steps via email for threshold operator

Start VisIt with -noconfig on the command line
Open some database and put up some mesh plot. Don't worry about drawing it though.
Add the threshold operator but do nothing to change it. Bring up the threshold operator attributes and Hit the 'save' button and give it a nice name ""default_threshold.xml"".
Exit VisIt.
Now, start VisIt as you would normally, add a plot and a threshold operator. Bring up threshold operator attributes and hit the load button and load the ones you just saved. Hit apply. Hit Make default if you want that to be your new default. And, if so, be sure to save settings.

We have hit an issue with 2.8.x/trunk and our internal TyphonIO format where VisIt crashes when carrying out Filled Boundary plots for some patch based AMR datasets without existing ghost cells. I'm not able to provide an example in another format at this time.
It is caused by a long standing issue in avtStructuredDomainBoundaries which has been exposed by the enabling of the AMRStitchCell operator by default in 2.8. It can be worked around by using the -disable-ghosts-for-t-intersections command line flag and made to occur in VisIt 2.7.3 via -create-ghosts-for-t-intersections.
The actual bug is down to the SetExistence function not excluding RECIPENT_NEIGHBOR patches like SetNewBoundaryData does so some cells are incorrectly marked as existing. The same underlying routines are called to generate ghost cell data when carrying out contour plots and, although this has not been observed to be fatal, valgrind confirms that uninitialised memory is accessed.
I have a fix ready to commit (which continues to pass the operators/amr_stitch.py regression test) but unfortunately the SVN server appears to be down at the moment.

We use WildcardStringMatch, a function defined in Utility.C (as an aside, I think all string related functionality should be moved to StringHelpers.C). This method is used in at least these places
	
matching filename extension with database plugins
matching hostnames in host profiles



WildcardStringMatch supports 3 meta characters
	
* which matches a whole string of characters
? which matches any single character
# which matches any digit character



Ok, here are some oddities
	
The internals do a case-insenstive character match. Why?
	
This might be relevant to hostname matching but not so much to filename matching (except maybe on OS X)
We have several plugins that define uppercase chars in their patterns but case-insensitivity makes that irrelevant
The name of the method doesn't suggest its case-insensitive. I assumed it wasn't until I ran into problems and looked at the source code.


The case-insenstive matching uses custom code instead of just using tolower stdlib method. Any idea if this is actually necessary?
	
As an aside, I noticed a similar thing in StringHelpers where we have a custom case insensitve string compare instead of just using strcasecmp. Again, is this really necessary?


The # supports the notion of a digit but only a single digit and only 09
	
not hex digits (e.g. 0xFA10)
not chars that one might find in a float such as e/E, +/- and .)
If you want to support filename extensions like *.exo.1.0 as well as *.exo.1024.0010, you have to specify patterns with 1 and 4 # chars


You cannot define a file pattern that uses a literal # character. Might be strange but why are we excluding it?
Turns out only 3-4 plugins actually use any meta chars in their file pattern definitions. I don't think this capability is well known. The Exodus plugin has been in poor shape on this point and fixing it resolves a couple of issues for Exodus users at ARL for example.

Should we switch to a more general regular expression approach? I think regex's are difficult for people to grasp. OTOH, using Exodus plugin as an example (which defines about 7 basic extensions), and thinking of 1 million cores, we'd have 7*7=49 extensions to cover all the possibilities whereas only 7 regex's would cover all of them. And, its easier to craft regexs that don't need to get re-visited with minor changes in conventions on how files are named or when different groups of users choose slightly different conventions (around a common base extension).
We could define/adopt a more abstract filenaming schema similar to the way the Unix date function defines a schema for printing of dates (and times) which supports notion of things like block counts, processor ranks, cycle numbers, timesteps, base extension, problem tag, etc. In fact, the combination of regexs and a filename schema of sorts might enable VisIt to do a better job teasing relevant information from filenames alone.

I had a user call that had opened a text file with data arranged in columns. The user just opened it so it used the PlainText reader with the default options. The user then used the scatter plot to create the plot since that was all that was available. The user then wanted to use the box operator, which gave an error about the pipeline being used improperly. This should probably work. I gave the user a work around by having them open the file and set the PlainText properties to specify which columns were the X, Y and Z coordinates. At that point he could use all the regular plots and use all the operators.

When I build visit on cz (need to build as the installed mpicom module is incomplete, see #2090), mpicom links with slurm's pmi library, but python seems to have trouble resolving this at runtime when I try to run the test_mpicom.py test.

Had to iron out issues with mpicom python module first, but then when I ran the sim, visit was unable to save out images (perhaps every process was attempting to write to same file?), and python segv'd when I tried to quit the simulation (dumping core files).
I am not certain whether my mpicom solution (use a python interpreter linked with '-lpmi') is the cause, or fundamental problems with the sim.
Once it is verified to work correctly, I think the parallel version should be tested in our test suite along with the serial version.Would require the script be modified to accept command-line args telling it to run the serial or parallel version.

I've reasoned what I think is happening here. However, I won't have time to fix until I return from holiday vacation.
Whats happening is that that Exodus' ElementBlock decomposition is now being treated as an enum scalar instead of a material.
When parts of the enum scalar are turned off, the extents are changing. However, that apparently didn't used to happen when the same parts where turned off as a material.
So, I think the right answer is that somewhere in enum scalar selection, we need to decide NOT to change extents due to changes in the selection.
Now, I don't know if other use cases have a conflicting requirement; that extents should change when changes are made to an enum selection. I don't think that is the case as it would seem to be different than the way we handle selections for domains and materials, but maybe it is.

A user reported that he was using the histogram plot and he had 2 bins with over 100 million cells but only got counts up to 16 million in the 2 bins. When he increased the number of bins so that no bin had over 16 million cells it worked properly. I looked at the code and it was using floats for the bin counts, which would explain this. We should change it to double. Here is the user's e-mail.
Greetings,
I have model output from SAMRAI that has about 130 million cells.  If I compute a histogram with 2 bins, it only shows about 16 million cells (maybe 2^24 ?) in each bin.  If I increase the number of bins so that no bin has more than 16 million entries, then it seems to count correctly.  I have reproduced this with the latest release (2.8.2) and a previous release (2.7).
Has anyone else seen this?

If -forceversion is used (or automatically added by frontendlauncher when -v x.y.z is used) on command line, there may be problems with saving movies when visit_composite is called.  You will get an error like this:
Running: visit_composite2.8.2 -forceversion 2.8.2 viewport.info /path/to/TEST0000.ppmCould not open parameter file -forceversion
This started in 2.8.2 because the order of args was swapped in frontendlauncher.py, adding '-forceversion' to the beginning of the list where before it was appended.
This causes a problem with visit_composite because it has specific expectations for its first argument.
A workaround:  modify visitmovietemplate.py to call 'visit_composite' instead of 'visit -composite' and change frontendlauncher.py to exclude 'visit_composite' from having '-forceversion' added to its command line (the way it is excluded from mpeg2encode).
Or visit_composite could be modified so that it doesn't rely on positional arguments, but accepts and parses arguments differently.

-----Original Message-----From: KASSBOHM [mailto:kassbohm@fiziko.de]Sent: Wednesday, December 31, 2014 2:49 AMTo: VisIt software users communitySubject: [visit-users] quadratic cells: vector-plot
Hi all,
I would like to make a vector-plot of a nodal field defined on quadratic cells.
I have the components of the field in my database. But after defining an expression for the vector-field, I get the warning shown below - and no vector plot is generated.
--- warning ---
The compute engine ... issued the following warning: The data set has a quadratic element in it and this code to convert 2D elements to polydata is only capable of 1:1 cell to cell translation, whereas quadratic cells produce a 1:N translation. Please contact a VisIt developer to resolve this issue. ...
--- end of warning ---
Attached is an example exodusii-file containing 4 quadratic shell elements and one linear beam element. After reading in the expression ""U"", the vector plot is only showing the vector field defined on the nodes of the linear beam element - but not the vector field on the nodes of the quadratic shell elements.
Any ideas to resolve the issue?

I went into a 2x2 layout and then wanted to do a multi-window save.
I was surprised by my first result. A largely black image with a tiny single window in the lower, left corner. It render all 4 windows on top of each other!
I guess I had assumed it would 'do the right thing' and save a multi-window that was equiv to the 'layout' I had chosen.
In cases that windows are not moved or adjusted in size following a 'layout' setting, I think this should happen automagically.
Even when windows are moved or adjusted in size, I still think it should be possible for VisIt to make an educated guess about what the user wants in the way of a multi-window save and then prime the settings for it from that.
Certainly, VisIt should probably warn the user when settings are such that windows will overlap substantially.

If user doesn't have ImageMagick convert program on their system, or in their path, templated movies for formats other than PPM and mpeg will fail.  Either user will get an error stating that 'convert' could not be found, or (on Windows) errors regarding invalid parameters.  These errors show up in the cli window.
We currently don't test whether the 'correct' convert program (ImageMagick convert) is available.
On Windows, there is a 'convert.exe' in systems folder that gets used, definitely not the right thing to be doing!
We should provide an alternative, or at the very least, check if the correct convert program is available, and if not tell user that it cannot create movie frames in the chosen format (for templated movies, this means formats that are neither PPM or mpeg movie).

2110,Pending,Feature,Normal, adjust default vector plot attributes to relatively prime stride ,-,-,-,Mark Miller,01/07/2015,,0%,,01/07/2015 01:37 pm,02/17/2015 04:34 pm,,,2.12.3,3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"
Default vector plot attributes draws 400 vectors. However, I don't know how the plot determines which of the 400 vectors to plot. In any event, it is all too often the case that the default plot winds up sampling the mesh positions such that the resulting 'shape' of the plotted glyphs doesn't nicely cover the whole object. This happens a lot.
I think we either need to adjust the sampling algorithm for the target glyph count method or (much easier) switch to a default of 'stride' but set stride to a number that is relatively prime to the mesh dimensions (am assuming mesh dimensions can be known in the plot attributes -- maybe they can't be) in which case choose a 'stride' of 'auto' by default and the plot filter can decide it.
This would alleviate situations where default behavior often winds up being misleading to users.
As an aside, it would be better to allow the stride setting to be float greater than or equal to one. Yes, its called 'stride' and is in fact used to walk through the array. However, the stride could be a float and the stride algorithm could just round the offset into the array to the nearest integer index each time it needs to access the underlying vector array data. This would make it much more flexible in arriving at a decent value for a stride in a dataset whose size is factored by several of the integers less than 10 say.

I encountered this first with some data from Spike. However, what I am seeing with Spike's data is re-producible with some 2D test data.
Open arbpoly-zoohybrid.silo.Plot mesh of 2D->mesh1_phzlPlot label of same mesh and show both nodes and cellsNow, pick on zone 9. PIck returns correct zone number but only 3 nodes for this zone even though this is a 6-noded zone and the nodes are wrong.Try picking on zone 6 too. You get correct zone number but incorrect node numbers. It returns a node, 26, that isn't even in the original mesh.
In helping to debug it, try doing a label plot of an expression of zonetype_label(2D->mesh1_phzl). It will show 'tri' for the 6 noded polygons.
Now, for the arbitrary polygons in this 2D mesh, the Silo plugin is reading those polygons but decomosing into triangles. It may not be appropriate to do this for 2D meshes any more as VTK appears to have decent support for arbitrary 2D shapes (e.g. polygons). In any event, the Silo plugin is doing much the same thing it does in 2D as it does in 3D with arbitrary shapes; decomposing those shapes into zoo-type shapes. The 2D dataset mentioned here is just a good way to test how VisIt is handling this and it appears to not be honoring the original mesh.
When VisIt performs a pick, I think it needs to know if the mesh has undergone some restructuring transformation (such as arb->zoo) and if so, then check if the picked zone is part of a zone that has undergone restructuring (not exactly sure how the Pick algorithm could know that though except to look at all its neighbor zones and ask if any have the same 'original' zone id. If they do, then Pick needs to go look at all the zones with the same original zone id, and collect the node ids from those. And, for those nodes, keep those whose original node id is appropriate (I don't know how we tag new nodes that are introduced for purposes of restructuring the mesh. I checked and it looks like Silo code tags avtOriginalNodeNumbers with the pair (domain-id, -1) so a negative 1 value for a avtOriginalNodeNumbers would inform Pick NOT to include that node in pick output.
I think arbitrary polyhedra are becomming more common and so I rated as occasional rather than rare.

text overlapping
text running off screen
text not scaling well as image size is varied
text not saving well when saving images



Python Code Examples
	
A lot of our examples apparently using older python (1.7)
Would like examples updated to use newest python
I explained 3.0 was a challenge for us due to some major changes
Update to CLI manual?



Session File issues
	
major pain moving session files between machines (if with using restore with different sources)
AWE users have given up on session files entirely, they do everything manually
Recommend teleconf with Paul Selby / Matt Wheeler to collect from the usage issues
Recommend following up with Josef Crepeau to get more details on session file issues
In client/server session file is saved to client and would like to save to server



DOD HPC Web
	
Would like to integrate VisIt better there / support it better
I don't really know what this is

Additional Issues / Details

Use the extra CNTA funds we have to improve the user interface / invest in useability.
Problem where the fonts are specified as a percentage of the screen size, so when you switch to a different monitor they can change in size and sometimes run off the window.
Wants to save his session file in the same place that his data is, not on his local machine (I guess hes running in client-server mode).
Session files are difficult to restore correctly (cant be shared).  Two users were in the same room with a seemingly identical connection and couldnt share session files successfully.


I could have sworn I had trouble using the same session file I saved in the Gnome Desktop virtual application on the HPC portal in the SRD environment.
Since it takes a long time for my images to render, Id like to be able to restore a session with sources and not have it automatically re-render all the images.
I was trying to make a tiled movie, and it didnt seem to matter much whether I used 1 processor or 16 processors---apparently, based on the timing of the messages I was getting, it was taking about 80% of the run time just loading in our tecplot-like .plt files.  I couldnt ever keep the connection open long enough to make the whole movie (I estimated 60 hours.  Each file was about 9GB.), so I had to settle for simple movies of each tile.  Each of those took about 7 hours to put ~60 frames into a .wmv movie with a 0.5 second dwell time for each frame.  Perhaps I need to switch to 2000 processors.  :-)

So, I've learned that the more places checksums for our download files are repeated, the more 'security' they provide.

Many users believe that if you just add more processors to VisIt's engine, it will always have the effect of making VisIt go faster.
However, in general, VisIt does not re-decompose the input data. It is able to process in parallel on a number of processors that is not more than the number of parts the input database is block into. For image and some netcdf files, I believe VisIt can re-decompose those on the fly, but that is the exception rather than the rule.
Although making VisIt warn users about possible under-utilization is undesireable, we can provide information in the Compute Engine's window from which they can make that determination for themselves.
This ticket is to enhance Compute Engine window with information on processor utilization of past (maybe past several) executes. What percent were idle, maybe what memory usage is across them, maybe even load balance. Heck, how about a VisIt plot that displays load balance of most recent engine executes?

From Jean Favre:
==================
With this mail, I simply wanted to report on some problem I had connecting to an in-situ demo, and the reason/solution I have found. I don't recall seeing this documented on the web pages, so it might be interesting to bring that up.
The problem is that I could not connect reliably to any demo (nothing from tools/DataManualExamples/Simulations).
This was a problem on one desktop, but not the other one. So something was fishy in the config file...
it turns out that the following line in the config file
<Field name=""treatAllDBsAsTimeVarying"" type=""bool"">true</Field>
would cause things to go wrong. It would connect, but the Simulations panel was never enabled.
switching back to ""treatAllDBsAsTimeVarying"" = false
fixes it and everything works fine. :-)
I have spent many hours trying to debug this. So if this can save you or other people some time...

However, sometimes thats combersome and when you know the variable names, its easier to just type 'em. However, it doesn't take what I type in. It seems to only take what I enter via the menus. If I type something in, I see it there but it doesn't take. Maybe one needs to tab out of the text box to force it to take?

With CMake 3.0 and above, we have to set CMake policy CP0033 to use old behavior, because we use export_library_dependencies.
CMake's documentation on policy CMP0033:
The export_library_dependencies() command should not be called.

This command was added in January 2003 to export <tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS internal CMake cache entries to a file for installation with a project. This was used at the time to allow transitive link dependencies to work for applications outside of the original build tree of a project. The functionality has been superseded by the export() and install(EXPORT) commands.

CMake >= 3.0 prefer that this command never be called. The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR when the command is called.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0. CMake version 3.0.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

We should figure out how to NOT use export_library_dependencies, so we are more up-to-date with current CMake practices.

Pick seems fragile, susceptible to failure for special cases.Logic for handling the special cases (Material selected, tetrahedralized (arbpoly), created vs non-create ghosts) etc, is convoluted at best and makes it hard to track down the source of failures to report correct information.
Seems like we should enumerate the special handling cases up front.Do we need 'RealIds'? Are they used to retrieve incident element information? or do we convert after this info is found.Do we need to look at avtOriginalNode/Zone arrays?  Do we do it up front, or convert from 'current' to 'original' at the end?How is this usage different than finding 'Real Ids'?

We were instrumenting a simulation and we added I-blanking to a curvilinear mesh via libsim. I-blanks are added to a curvilinear mesh by tagging on an array containing VISIT_GHOSTNODE_REAL/VISIT_GHOSTNODE_BLANK via VisIt_CurvilinearMesh_setGhostNodes. Under the covers in the SimV2 reader, this creates an ""avtGhostNodes"" array with NODE_NOT_APPLICABLE_TO_PROBLEM in it where we don't want the nodes or cells incident to that node to be present in the VisIt plots. Ghost nodes were used for blanking in the simulation because it thinks in terms of nodes.
VisIt had some problems using ghost nodes for I-blanking:1. A Contour plot completely ignored blanked nodes.2. A Pseudocolor+Slice plot did take the blanked nodes into account but it must have tried to remove the nodes post-slice because the interfaces where the nodes/cells were supposed to be blanked were jagged.
Granted, this type of I-blanking is probably not used much in VisIt and maybe libsim is the only way to input this kind of data but it should work. Ghost cells work.

Honestly, I think this should probably be the default but I don't think it is the default now.

1. Enhance internallauncher a little to enumerate the supported launcher/sublauncher configurations and store them in a VISIT_LAUNCHERS environment variable before starting the GUI.

It gets very frustrating attempting to figure out how and why data read in from the dataset gets changed BEFORE the first avt filter (avtMissinDataFilter) that gets dumped when using -dump.
We should figure out how to dump from the ghost-zone communication, from MIR (if it isn't already), and from anything else that transforms the data before the first avt filter in the pipeline.
Or perhaps they should all be avt filters that get added to the pipeline when needed (major infrastructure change)

VTK has vtkStringArray data type that can be stored in a dataset as celldata, pointdata or field data.It is easy to write files with this data type, and strings within a single array can have different lengths.
Supporting vtkStringArray throughout the pipeline would require changes to how cell/point data is retrieved as it is not a derived type of vtkDataArray, but of vtkAbstractArray.
For quick support, we could modify the VTK reader to recognize this data, and convert it to vtkCharArrays in the GetVar call.

However, if I select another query category like ""Max"", I get a nice graph over the range of time steps selected.

Looks like this is the old issue of too-many database plugins.During installation, if the number of installed plugins is limited (Choose components page),then startup is fine (not sure yet how many is 'too many').
Would limiting the default-enabled database plugins be a better option?
Did the number of plugins change that drastically between 2.8.2 and 2.9?Or did something else change that is causing the problem?

This is a bug Bruce Hammel claims to have been experiencing with VisIt for years, so I've set the priority as high, now that I have reproducible steps.
This seems only to occur with 2 nodes. Multiple processors on single node does not replicate.Also seems only to occur in conjunction with CoordSwap operator, and with Pick var being set to an expression (and not the pipeline var)
On surface: (ensure parallel engine with 2 nodes)
Open multi_curv2d.siloAdd PC Plot of dAdd CoordSwap operator, swap x and y coordsDraw.Create a scalar expression d+p,Open Pick window, set variable to d+p.Apply
Do a Zone PickUsing Navigation, change the view either by zooming or panning.Do another Zone Pick.Engine will hang, must cancel the engine_par job in order to interact with VisIt again.
Information window shows Pick wanting to re-execute, and a merge exception:
++++++++++++++VisIt does not have all the information it needs to perform a pick.  Please wait while the necessary information is calculated.  All current pick selections have been cached and will be performed when calculations are complete.  VisIt will notify you when it is fully ready for more picks.
Shortly thereafter, the following occured...
Pseudocolor:  (InvalidMergeException)viewer: Cannot merge datasets because of an incompatible field 1 and 2.
Pick mode now fully ready.+++++++++++++++++++
This shows error seeming to come from the viewer, but if you run with -debug 5, then 2 processors' log files will show this error:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This source should not load balance the data.Exception: (InvalidMergeException) /usr/tmp/brugger/aztec/visitbuild/visit2.8.2/src/avt/Pipeline/Data/avtDataAttributes.C, line 1360: Cannot merge datasets because of an incompatible field 1 and 2.catch(VisItException) /usr/tmp/brugger/aztec/visitbuild/visit2.8.2/src/engine/main/Executors.h:1027++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

data files attached
from customer's email:
visit_s.Nek5000 -> rofcavity0.f00001: single precisionvisit.Nek5000 -> rs8cavity0.f00001 : double precision
These are same meshes by [0,1]x[0,1] but one is single  and the other double precision. When show the mesh with double precision, the scale of axis becomes to 10^36 on the begining.
It seems to me that the problem occurs when call function
avtNek5000FileFormat::GetBoundingBoxIntervalTree(int timestep)
in database/Nek5000/avtNek5000FileFormat.C.
In the function, for single precision ""iFileSize == iFileSizeWithoutMetaData"", i.e.  the condition
...      if (iFileSize < iFileSizeWithoutMetaData+iMDSize)
        {            errorReadingData = 1;            break;        }...is satisfied and then break.
However for double precision,
iFileSize > iFileSizeWithoutMetaData+iMDSize
(since used sizeof(float) for iFileSizeWithoutMetaData!!)
So, the code continue to
...   for (ii = 0; ii < iNumBlocks; ii++)
    {        double b6;        b0 = (double)bounds[ii*6];        b1 = (double)bounds[ii*6+1];        b2 = (double)bounds[ii*6+2];...
However ""bounds"" with float type to read 8bytes' double precision, this is why boundarybox becomes infinity.
Of course, we can change for double precision to...       boost::int64_t iFileSizeWithoutMetaData = 136                 + sizeof(int)*aBlocksPerFile[ii]                 + ((boost::int64_t)nFloatsPerDomain)*sizeof(double)*((boost::int64_t)aBlocksPerFile[ii]);
boost::int64_t iMDSize = (nFloatsPerDomain * 2 * sizeof(double) * aBlocksPerFile[ii]) /                     (iBlockSize[0]*iBlockSize[1]*iBlockSize[2]);
and it works.
But I don't understand why we need the function because  the code stop in the line...     if (iFileSize < iFileSizeWithoutMetaData+iMDSize)
        {            errorReadingData = 1;            break;        }...
For 3D cases, there are other bugs. I will prepare for small case for you. At the moment, it is impossible send by email due to size of limit.

I went to run the test suite on Mac and it was not able to import PIL. I tried ""import PIL"" using the Python that build_visit had made for me and still no luck. I blew away my python build and had build_visit do it over. I noticed that it was not able to build Pillow (I guess we switched to Pillow). I tried building Pillow manually following the steps in the build_pillow function from bv_python.sh. I could not get the build to work because the Python that build_visit created for me was missing the ez_build stuff that lets ""python setup.py build"" work.
I was able to fix it like this:1. Download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py2. python ez_setup.py
Then build pillow3. python ./setup.py build4. python ./setup.py install

GUIBase.C has helper functions that convert from double to QString and back again for use with LineEdits.
According to Qt 4.8 documentation, QString.setNum(double) by default uses 'g' format with precision of 6.I think we should change our use of setNum for double to increase the precision, perhaps to 17?
Then ensure all GUI windows accepting doubles use the GUIBase helper methods: DoubleToQString (and variants),and LineEditGetDouble (and variants).  This will help maintain consistency.
Writing to config files also needs to be updated to preserve more precision when saving settings.

I think the fact we're one of the 10 biggest consumers of inode space out of over 1250 projects there suggests we should do something about moving our test suite results. Why are we keeping litererally every night's results going back as far as we can? I mean does anyone ever look back more than 30 days? If not, maybe it makes sense to do the following. . .

Keep every night going back 2-4 weeks (about 15-30 results)
Keep one per week (say Sunday night's) after that going back another 5 months (about 20 more results)
Keep one per month (say first Sunday night's) after that going back 2.5 years (about 30 more results)
Keep nothing older than 3 years

Thats less than 90 results we'd keep and is >3x smaller than what we have there today (which will grow without bound until we run out of inodes again and tests stop posting). Or, if we really, really do wanna actually keep more results, we could keep them in 'archieved' form by taring them up into a single file (thereby saving all the inodes), but then looking at those archived results would involve more work.

This came up during first VisIt (basic) tutorial.
In PC plot (and others where appropriate) we have the ability to let min/max foat with whatever those values are for the current timestep. I think the word MIN in the min text box and the word MAX in the max text box indicate the float behavior. We also have the ability to manually set them to some explicit values.
User's would like another option here. That is, to use whatever the current min/max values are. Its sort of like locking the min/max values to whatever current values are. As an aside, it would also be nice if the actual numerical values for min and max appeared in the GUI's text boxes. But, that is somewhat secondary to simply being able to fix them to whatever the current values are.
I am thinking MIN@idx where idx is some timestate index would work where maybe NOW, TMIN and TMAX might be possible monikers for the current timestate, the first timestate or the last timestate.

This came up at the basic VisIt tutorial and applies to things like lineouts, rotations in nagivate mode and maybe rubber-band-box outs in zoom mode.
The idea is that a user would like to take a horizontal (x-axis parallel) or vertical (y-axis parallel) lineout and would like to drag while holding down some key (typically the shift key) to cause the drag to snap to these directions. Common snap-to directions are verticle, horizontal and 45 degrees. It might make sense to have a little bit finer granularity here but whatever.
For rotations in navigate mode, a user wants to rotate only about y axis or only about x axis and would snap their drag motion to affect that. Note that in 3D, a snap for a radial drag even might be novel too as that would be a rotate about z axis. Also, maybe the number of degrees the object is rotated is snapped too, maybe in 22.5 degree incriments or something.
We have textual commands to affect this in the options->viewe command text box. But, these gestures are sometimes easier. Other software often provides them and users are accustomed to using these gestures in other circumstances.

When --mesa is added to the build_visit command line, it invokes the Mesa build, which uses configure to find a ""python2"" interpreter on the system.

When the script finally builds VisIt, the same folder will be uncompressed again (I see in the script that it doesn't check for an existing ""visit2.9.0"" folder, I don't know if it's intentional, so I left it as it is).
Let me know if you have any question and keep me posted on the integration!
Thanks,Matthieu

We have the ability to change any plot's attributes and, in particular, make some set of attributes the default for a plot. We can even save these to files and load them from files.
What we do not have is the ability to easily save and give a name to individual plot/operator/selection attributes/settings or combinations thereof.
For example, Barbara likes to use FilledBoundary plot a particular way for certain observations. Wireframe, single-color, white. She would like to save that particular set of plot attributes as a variation on the FilledBoundary plot and then be able to select it just underneath the FilledBoundary plot menu.
Next, she would like the ability to save combinations of plots, operators and views and then apply those to a given variable when she opens a database.
This is different from and similar to session files. It is different in that it is only part of a session and that it doesn't involve saving and restoring to/from a file on the filesystem (extra steps). And, frees from having to deal with different sources when the same operators and plots are desired to be applied to different variables in different databases.

VisIt has logic to decide which axis to revolve for revolved_volume operator. But, it requires that the database have specified RZ, ZR or XY mesh type. And, in the case of XY type, it assumes X and that isn't always going to be the right choice. The revolved_volume expr should have an option to specify either X or Y (or R or Z) axis explicitly.

FindSilo.cmake apparently sets up variables associated with the Silo library. Its ultimate aim, like most FindXXX.cmake modules in VisIt, is to call SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY.
But, SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY's 4th arg, libs, is not for indicating what additional libraries a package depends on. It is for indicating what additional libaries a package implements.
In fact, there does not appear to be any way via SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY to indicate what libs a package depends on.
So, even if we can add logic to FindSilo.cmake to decide if Silo depends on zlib (see below for a patch to do that), it doesn't help us because there appears to be no way to tell SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY about dependent libs.
If silo is configured with compression (which it typically is by default and one has to explicitly disable them), then Silo has a direct dependence on zlib. However, whether to add 'z' to silo or siloh5 targets is currently not being handled in FindSilo.cmake.
Why does VisIt build fine in spite of this? Thats because in most cases, VisIt's build is being driven by a config-site file and there is logic in construction of VISIT_SILO_LIBDEP and VISIT_HDF5_LIBDEP to set up library dependencies correctly. And, this logic winds up skirting any failings in FindSilo.cmake.
So, its a non-issue for config-site builds which I think represents a majority of our builds (so I rated this issue as rare). It is an issue for others.
The correct long term solution is probably to fix FindSilo.cmake to set up proper/correct direct library dependencies (e.g. what does Silo library depend on) and then to utilize CMake's built-in mechanisms for handling indirect dependencies and eliminating our VISIT_XXX_LIBDEP variables.

Hopper has multiple gcc versions available via modules. I wanted to explicitly specify the path to a gcc that I had load via modules so I would not accidentally get some other gcc on the system. Of course, this caused the auto-generated name for the install directories to include the path to the gcc compiler, which is not what I expected.

Al runs multiple instances of VisIt on his Windows machine.  He often gets the 'do you want to restore from a crash recovery file' message when he launches, mainly because another instance of VisIt is running and has created the crash recovery file.
He suggests a couple of options to prevent this annoyance:1)  don't check for crash-recovery files on Windows if you are running with command-line-options (like -o)2)  Save and look for crash-recovery files in location where VisIt was launched (not DOCUMENTS/Visit). Since he launches VisIt by double-clicking on .visit files in different folders, this would prevent multiple instances of VisIt wanting to use the same crash-recovery file.
Option 2 gets tricky if VisIt thinks its launch location is the same as the install, or if user doesn't have write permissions for the launch location.
I pointed Al to the preference that turns off the feature, but he doesn't necessarily want to use that preference as he sometimes finds the crash recovery files to be useful.
Any other ideas?

I built a new version of the Xdmf reader to override the installed Xdmf reader on hopper. I could not tell whether my plugin was being used or not because Xdmf is a standard VisIt plugin and the Plugin Manager window alphabetizes the plugin names. User plugins are loaded first but I could not tell. It would be nice if the Plugin Manager window had an indication of whether the plugin is from the user or the installed directory.

Kevin Roe would like to have the maintain view limits setting saved when he saves the configuration. Here are the important parts of the e-mail exchange on the subject.
Hi Mark,I see what you mean, but that's not what I was thinking it would be like. My assumption is that it would maintain the limits during a session. I expected the limit would be reset at the end of the session and start from fresh for the next session. Mostly what I want is for the view to be maintained during a session. I don't care what happens after the session ends. Preserving that is what the save session feature is for.-Kevin
Well, I checked 2.9.2 and current trunk and it would appear the behavior your describing also exists in those versions.
So, on to next question. Is this intentional?
I suspect it may be. I think if 'maintain view limits' is always enabled the question becomes what does that mean across VisIt startups?
Does it mean the view limits that were last in effect when VisIt was exited should be the same limits used when it is restarted? What happens if upon the next startup, the database being viewed is wholly different with different view extents, etc.
I am not sure if this is a workable behavior in practice.
Can you maybe elaborate on why you would like 'maintain view limits' to always be on?

Hi VisIt Team,I prefer the Maintain View Limits option to be checked on the advanced tab on the View Controls menu.  Unfortunately, pushing save options seems to not work in the case of this option.  Is this intentional?Thanks,-Kevin

VisIt already has a notion of missing data. When mesh variables with missing data are plotted, I am not sure whether VisIt ghosts them out or colors them specially to indicate no values are defined there. But, bottom line, we have a notion of missing data for mesh variables.
I am thinking of the time query case Kathleen demonstrated in the tutorial where it was at a fixed point in space and the mesh moved such that the point was outside the mesh. We should treat this the same as we treat missing data. VisIt should be able to indicate in the resulting plotted curve that the value there is not defined either by coloring that segement of the lineout differenly or some other visual queue.

Barb Kornblum had saved settings with some macros defined in the macro tab. From then on whenever she started VisIt the python command window would appear on startup. This was annoying to her. I finaly found that the macros were stored in ./visit/visitrc. The presence of this file caused the python CLI to be launched. If you have macros stored in the numbered tabs on the macro window, they don't get stored in the visitrc file and you don't have this issue. VisIt will only start the cli if the user executes one of the numbered macros. This seems like the correct behavior for the macros under the macro tab.

This came up because of different behavior of the IndexSelect operator in serial/parallel due to two things: decomposition, and the 'wrap' option for IndexSelect not working for multiblock data (data is single block, but decomposed when run in parallel).

Here is the feature request from Dan.
Hi Eric,
The feature I'm requesting is to modify the XRay Query to write out the pathlength field separately from the emission field.  This will enable multi-group backlights to be imposed after the Query is run, so that users can study different backlighting strategies when designing experiments.
For now, users can re-run the Query and supply different multigroup background intensities which is a decent work around.
The detail of the feature request is as follows (based on the code in VisIt 2.9.1, avtXRayFilter::IntegrateLines(),
Each zone has:a : absoprtivitye : emissivity
and we compute tmp[i] = exp( - a[i] * seqLength)   (for energy bin 'i')tmp is the 'path length' through the zone (typically denoted by 'tau').   VisIt by default integrates intensities and accumulates them, for bin 'i':
radBins[i] *= tmp[i]    // attenuate incoming radiation by pathlength through current zoneradBins[i] += (1-tmp[i]) * e[i]/a[i]    // add in self emission of current zone
Instead, I propose we add a pathlengh array (per bin, just like radBins), and keep the total pathlength as well:pathLength[i] += tmp[i]radBins[i] = <same as before>
Then write both radBins and pathLength as separate binary outputs.  Perhaps this could be turned on only in raw-floats mode if you like.

Hello all,
I receive the following error message when I try to add any plot from an ensight (.case) file:""viewer: An invalid variable (Velocity) was specified"".
This file is written by starccm code.  So far, I haven't had any problem with such files in my previous simulations. But, the current file might be somehow different which causes the error. The only difference that I know is that there are several parts (here interfaces between regions) in the file which do not have any data (e.g., velocity) associated with.
So I wondered if anyone has any solution to this issue. I would be happy to sent you the file in case it is required.
Regards,Mohsen
He also gave me a file, which reproduces the problem. Note that the mesh displays properly. It is just variables that don't display.
The file is located in /usr/gapps/visit/bug_data/EnSight_reader_bug_2273.zip on the local open WCI network.

We discovered that there is no easy way to handle curves with missing data or bad values.
However, by default, we wind up plotting curves with no points and connecting lines and this can be misleading on, for example, query over time where certain queried values aren't present. This leads to plots that users find misleading and then have to turn on features to debug what they are seeing.
Changing default curve plotting behavior to plot points would reduce the liklihood of this issue.

Hello,
I'm trying to overlay a ScatterPlot on a Pseudocolor plot with datafrom two different files, and I think this shows up a bug in VisIt:(using VisIt 2.9.1 on Linux, from the latest 64-bit Ubuntu 11.04binary download)
Steps to reproduce:1) Open curv3d.silo from the visit_data_files.tar.gz (it doesn't haveto be Silo format, but this allows easy reproducibility)2) Plot Pseudocolor of ""u"" 3) For the same window, open scatter_new.okc (inline below - fairlysimple Xmdv format file)4) Plot Scatter -> x5) In the Scatter Plot Setup window, I want to select ""y"" as thesecond variable, and ""z"" as the third (and perhaps ""p"" as the colorvariable)However, the variables shown in the drop-down menus seem to be fromcurv3d.silo, not scatter_new.okc, so I can't do this.
If I select any variable from curv3d.silo, exit the Scatter Plot Setupdialog box, and then edit the Scatter properties, I do see the correctvariables from scatter_new.okc so this is one solution.
The other solution/workaround is to plot the ScatterPlot first, but itseems this shouldn't be necessary.
Is this an actual bug in VisIt or am I missing something obvious?
Given that there are two easy workarounds, this is a fairly minorproblem, but it would be nice if it could be fixed, and might affectother multi-file plots.
Thanks,
Philip Blakely

In the ReadEnvironmentFromCommand function inside libsim, which is used to read the VisIt environment, we limit the buffer used to store the environment to 10k. This enough for most cases. I was contacted by a user who said that the 10k limit was causing the environment to get truncated and this caused the load of the libsim runtime to fail. We will need to either bump up the limit (maybe 32k) or change the code so it can support various buffer sizes.

When a label plot is created for a mesh with chunk dimensions that vary between chunks, it appears that the cell coordinates are generated using the width of the first chunk encountered. For subsequent chunks, if the chunk dimensions differ to those of the first chunk, the generated cell coordinates are incorrect.
Attached is a plot where chunk 0 is 7 cells wide and chunk 1 is 6 cells wide. In the second chunk, the first column of the second row is incorrectly labelled 6,0 where it should actually be 0,1. If chunk 0 is excluded using a SIL restriction, the labelling in chunk 1 is correct but the labelling in chunk 2 is still wrong.
I have attached a very-simple multi-chunk vtk file that can be used to show the issue.
This behavior was spotted in version 2.9.0 but was also found in versions 2.7.2 and 2.5.2 (and presumably others).

I am looking at a single vtk file (so single block) with a serial engine.
While stepping through with a debugger, I seemed to be spending a lot of time stepping through data trees, so I ran with -dump.
The first filter dumped (avtMissingDataFilter) shows the input avtDataTree to have three nodes, with a single leaf at node 2.   The single leaf is expected, but not the tree depth.  I would expect at most 2 nodes, the root and the leaf, though single-node seems optimal.  Somewhere between the reader and this filter, we create a tree 3-deep.  That seems wrong.
I looked at the dumped input/output avtDataTrees for every filter in my pipeline and discovered that avtFacelistFilter increased the depth by 1.  That also seems wrong.The facelist filter was applied twice in my pipeline, so the extra depth became more noticeable.
Not sure how much of a performance hit we take because of this, but it slowed down my debugging session considerably.

It doesn't make sense every time someone makes a small change to the manual that each person so doing also needs to re-gen the live help pages.
It makes more sense to do this as one of the last steps in making a (major) release. I put 'major' in paranthesis because it might also make sense to make it part of minor releases.
That said, it turns out that changes to manual content are really, really rare at this point. In fact, I think we've been kicking around the idea of making wholesale changes to the manual (perhaps moving to a wiki for example), to help reduce barriers to manual upkeep.
In any event, I filed this ticket to ask what we should do about changes to manual content and re-gening live help

Mark Stowell installed VisIt on a mac in a directory where one of the directory names contained a space. VisIt wouldn't launch because of it. We should fix this. Here is the text of Mark's e-mail.
Hello,
I recently installed the latest VisIt (2.9.1) using the precompiled binary distribution for Mac OS X.  Unfortunately, it refused to start.  The icon would bounce once of twice in the dock then nothing.
I tracked down the problem but I don't know the solution.  The problem was that the path where I had installed the application contained a space in one of the directory names.  The launcher scripts use 'dirname' to determine the location of the application but this fails because it sees more than one string on the command line.
Fortunately I was able to rename the offending directory but the launcher scripts should probably be modified to handle this situation.
Thank you,Mark

Exception: (InvalidVariableException) /work/visit/warp-visit/visit-src/avt/DBAtts/MetaData/avtDatabaseMetaData.C, line 6312: An invalid variable (operators/DataBinning) was specified.
He tracked down the cause of the exception (from his email):the crux of the issue is inavtVolumePlot::GetLogicalBounds        this method is attempting to compute the bounds of the dataset from the database reader itself. When the method calls GetMeshForVariable with the variable name that results from using the data binning the exception occurs, the database has no variable named that.
GetLogicalBounds should probably catch the exception, so as not to fail.
We should also have a way to determine the mesh associated with an operator-created variable.

See #2301 for motivation, Volume Plot wanted logical bounds, attempted to retrieve from mesh meta data, but mesh name couldn't be determined from operator-create variable 'operators/DataBinning'.
We have methods for traversing the input avtDataTree to determine data bounds, and spatial extents.  Logical extents could be handled in the same manner, and would do nothing if input was not structured.  IIRC, avtDatasetExaminer, CommonDataFunctions and avtDataTree would need to be modified.

if two dbs have the same time instances but in different units, they cannot be easily coorelated using time.
For example, suppose one db has times 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 in units of seconds and the other 100, 200 and 300 in units of milliseconds. VisIt doesn't know the units difference between then and a 'nearest neighbor' correlation will put all 3 of the first dbs times on the first time of the second db.
This can be remedied by allowing the user to specify an optional offset and scale factor to use to relate times in one db relative to the other.

We offer a slew of save-as image formats. Why? Eric's emperical experience (and mine as well) is that PNG produces the smallest image files with the highest quality. However, I am not entirely sure if PNG is lossless compression. I think it is. But, in any event, tiff can be used without any compression whatsoever. We think those two image formats are the only formats we need to support.
Note that we also support curve (curve and ultra) and 3d formats (stl, obj, vtk) and we should keep those.
Our postscript output is brain dead. It saves a raster image using the postscript dialect. I thought it was at least smart enough for curves to save vector format. Perhaps it could be smartened to do so. But, even for curves, it saves a raster of the curve image in postscript and so for time being should probably also be eliminated.
Finally, its possible VTK has made a lot of improvements here that maybe our save-as code isn't taking advantage of and we should at least look into that (for vector postscript for curves anyways).

It isn't totally clear but there appears to be some minor relative re-positioning of plot elements when we save a window from VisIt using screen ratio saves.
Using screen ratio save should give an identically shaped (e.g. relative positions of all plot elements the same) image as what is displayed on the screen. But, it doesn't (always).
We believe the problem may be that VisIt is using the ''Windows'' ratio instead of the plot's viewport ratio within the window. The difference being the GUI widget elements which occupy some of window real estate.

Currently, VisIt saves all images with an (artificial) dpi of 72. By ''artificial'' I mean that VisIt is really targeting a total pixel count in width and hieight and so could assign any ''DPI'' setting it chooses.

Hello,
It would be great if VisIt could output transparent images with alpha channel. Please consider supporting transparent output in PNG format instead of adding  support to all formats like tiff, etc.
While the python difference workaround could be useful sometimes. It is not really possible to incur the cost of rendering twice just for the sake of generating a transparent image. This is especially true with raycasting or anything with larger dataset, which have expensive render times to begin with.

Hi Everyone,
I have been talking with Britton Chang @ LLNL who has been having issues with using client server from his windows laptop. Things seem to work  fine on his windows desktop with the RZ same account.
On his laptop - it works sometimes, when it works is not network dependent (He has tried on wireless, ethernet, and in different buildings at LLNL)
It fails at different stages in the process, for example:
*hangs before asking for password*hangs after vcl is launched, but before mdserver is launched*hangs just before mdserver allows browsing*hangs just after job submission
I believe each of these cases represents a point were we make a ssh connection, or setup a component to port forward via our ssh connection.
I did notice that in one case he had several zombie visit.exe and gui.exe instances. We killed them all but that didnt resolve the issues.
It seems that some aspect of the SSH tunnel is being thown off can causing a hang, or it could be we are running out of ports.
I was hoping someone could tell me magic to enable qtssh debugging on windows so maybe we can probe further.
If it is related to running out of ports, we should return this error message to the user instead of hanging.

Currently, the size of the moments and final scalar values are allocated to the same size as the lattice across all processors. However, only a subset of the moments and scalar values are calculated on each processor depending on what particles are present in the dataset. Also, the entire lattice is created on the root processor and all of its associated scalar values are gathered on the root processor.

I get something that is totally different. It is non-zero everywhere except (I think) at omega=0 where it is a large negative value. So, it appears kinda sort as inverse.

I thought we dealt with a problem similar to this due to float precision in Scatter plot. However, Scatter plot has been modified for double precision everywhere now.

Some time ago I reported banding issue on scatter plots. The problem
seemed to be solved but... Our team encountered again same problem. The
sample data is attached in this message (hdf5). Please do the scatter
plot ""dt"" vs ""p"". Seems ok  ? Right it is. Now please unselect the
normalize option in appearance tab - rescale and... Banding again (see
the attached jpg). Any idea how to solve it or what could cause the
problem (looks same as previos, sorted, problem).
Regards,

See attached file.
Do scatter plot with electrons_dt in X and electrons_p on y.
Go to appearence tab and de-check scale to unit cube.
You get a banded plot.
Thought it was related to narrow x-range of data. The x-bounds for the viewport are 1e-7 apart and was assuming GL hardware was having same kinds of problem as when we zoom in way to far.
Can be scaled independently in x and y if use expressions to scale the variables. However, user finds issues with that as well.
Jonathon Smith at Tech-X also reports.
I wanted to comment here. The underlying issue responsible for this
(treatment of double precision data as single precision) remains in
VisIt 2.9.2 on windows. The users we're supporting want to look at
non-transformed data. The end users we're working with want/need to have
the labels representative of the raw data, so ideas like scaling or
translating the data are not being received well.

The only way we could satisfactorily use an expression containing a
translation to the data (so it's centered on 0 to avoid this issue) is
if we could also force some sort of false labelling so that the data is
labelled as it would be with the original coordinates centered around
1.8e-7 seconds with variations of order +/- 1e-11. It seems that the other
visualisation tools we've tried have not run into such problems, and a
better solution would be to ensure we have a pipeline for native double
precision data. I'm happy to contribute to resolving this issue by
testing code, and even hacking source with guidance as needed. I think
the issues have not moved on much from those described in my older post
(13th March)

If I recall - the problem is that we call
avtTransformManager::NativeToFloat: needNativePrecision=false,
admissibleDataTypes={VTK_FLOAT,VTK_DOUBLE,}
this code is somewhere in
the engine, and shows up in the engine log at debug level 5. It may also
show up at lower levels, I've not checked, but it *is* still happening
in 2.9.2.
This statement clearly comes from
avt/Database/Database/avtTransformManager.C, but the problem is
understanding what's calling it and why.
It appears to be getting called within avtMissingDataFilter (not sure
why this is used here, as it appears the dataset is complete, but this
is probably my ignorance).

I think we'd learn something by instrumenting the ""if"" statement around
line 360 of plots/Scatter/avtScatterFilter.C with some extra debug
information, then to start working backwards from there.

Do we need to ensure that we call something similar to NativeToFloat,
called avtTransformManager::NativeToDouble: needNativePrecision=true

What is responsible for calling the transform manager,  and what might
we be able to do to modify it's behaviour. Presumably this was once
needed as VTK historically couldn't handle the double precision dataset.

The splatting volume renderer interferes with the Pseudocolor plot's color texturing in certain cases. That splatting renderer must not be saving/restoring enough GL state and some of its changes affect the Pseudocolor plot's color texturing.
1. Make a Volume plot of scalar_s.silo2. Change to the orangehot color table3. Set the min to 0.0001 and do log scaling4. Open dem.nc5. Add a Pseudocolor plot of 384x192_sl_dem10m.txt6. Change the Pseudocolor plot to the greens color table7. Apply an Elevate operator to the Pseudocolor plot8. Draw the plots.9. Interactively move the plots and the Pseudocolor plot will turn a little orange.
The discoloration persists even if you remove the Volume plot. If you clear the Pseudcolor plot and regenerate it, the plot will turn the right color again. It will discolor again if you rotate the plot.
1. This issue does not come up if you turn off ""apply color using textures"".2. This issue does not come up if you force zonal centering on the Pseudocolor plot.
This really looks to be a texturing GL state bug in the Splatting volume renderer.

There was a question at visitusers.org about setting the font on axis labels. It seems that newer VTK versions have a vtkTextProperty that enables the path to a TTF font file to be used. This enables texture-based fonts in VTK to be rendered using the specified font. It would be great to investigate this more and allow the use of system fonts for VisIt axis labels, legends, and text annotations.
Issues:1. Use Qt to locate and select font to use. Identify the file for the selected font and send to VTK text actor. This presents some client/server issues for SR mode. Send the font file to the server and cache it in ~/.visit?2. There may be no vector font that supports custom font files. Silly since font code will often make triangles from the TTF font and rasterize those triangles to a texture. A long time ago, I had a way of turning the font definition into triangles. There must still be a way to do this and make a VTK vector text actor suitable for 3D axis labels.3. Use a custom vector font in the Label plot.

I investigated this a bit more here at LBL talking to the BoxLib developers. There are different BoxLib file types, differentiated by the first line in Header. Most of the BoxLib files that I encountered are of type HyperCLaw"" and that seems to be the type that VisIt expects. Andy Nonaka at CCSE has a copy of one of the files Mark Converse sent him. This is a file of type CartGrid, which seems to have additional information in it. VisIt completely ignores the first line of the file with the type. I assume when we were developing the reader in the first place, we did not have any access to CartGrid files so it did not make any difference.

However, if we want to read other BoxLib file types correctly, we need to read the first line and check the file type. The main difference between HyperCLaw and CartGrid files seems to be that they contain a vfEps (1e-08 in your file) per level between dx (the line ""0.05 0.05 0.05 in your file) and coordSys (the line 0 following the 1e-8 in your file). Removing this line (or these lines if there is more than one level), should allow VisIt to read the file until the reader is modified.

Hi Mark,

I have debugged a bit more. IMHO, the problem is definitely with the Header file. The relevant section is below. . .

-2 -2 -2
2 2 2

((0,0,0) (79,79,79) (0,0,0))
100
0.05 0.05 0.05
1e-08
0
0
0 75 5.57623875809867e-06
100

Note the '1e-08' line.

VisIt's current plugin is expecting an integer there for the 'coordSys' data member of the Boxlib3D plugin. It reads as far as the '1' and sets coordSys int to 1. Then it attempts to read what it thinks is another 'integer' which I think is indicating if ghost zones are used. It tries to read the 'e-08' part via >> operator and that operation fails (i assume) or somehow the 'integer' value that gets set is '3'.

If I take out the 1e-08 line, neither boxlib nor VisIt crash anymore. However, I still don't get to a state where I can plot anything. The mdserver belives there are 75 blocks and a bunch of variables but VisIt's GUI menus are non-responsive.

I think somehow we're dealing with different file format versions.

Quote Modify  Hi all,
I have been working on implementing HDF5 with XDMF as the new I/O for the code I use. I believe I have came across a bug in the VisIt XDMF Plug-in but I could be wrong.
Whenever a dimension of the data in the attribute matches the last dimension of the mesh in the grid it is on, VisIt views the attribute as an array. As an example, I have recreated the issue using explicit values given in XML, however this is the same issue as when I point to HDF5 datasets. In the below example (attached as well) the Attribute ""U"" is seen as an array in VisIt, since the last dimension of the mesh grid it is on, 9, is also a dimension of the Attribute. When this dimension matching does not occur however, everything works as expected, as in for the ""V"" attribute.
I believe this is an issue in the VisIt plug-in because I could not cause this issue in p*r*view. I have used VisIt 2.9 and VisIt 2.7 and the same issue was present. If anyone has encountered this issue before or has an idea how to fix it, it would be greatly appreciated. Below is the example XDMF file that causes the error and the file information from VisIt.Troublesome XDMF File

From email report:Hi all,
I have been working on implementing HDF5 with XDMF as the new I/O for the code I use. I believe I have came across a bug in the VisIt XDMF Plug-in but I could be wrong.
Whenever a dimension of the data in the attribute matches the last dimension of the mesh in the grid it is on, VisIt views the attribute as an array. As an example, I have recreated the issue using explicit values given in XML, however this is the same issue as when I point to HDF5 datasets. In the below example (attached as well) the Attribute ""U"" is seen as an array in VisIt, since the last dimension of the mesh grid it is on, 9, is also a dimension of the Attribute. When this dimension matching does not occur however, everything works as expected, as in for the ""V"" attribute.
I believe this is an issue in the VisIt plug-in because I could not cause this issue in p*r*view. I have used VisIt 2.9 and VisIt 2.7 and the same issue was present. If anyone has encountered this issue before or has an idea how to fix it, it would be greatly appreciated. Below is the example XDMF file that causes the error and the file information from VisIt.
Thank you,Robert

Enhance the visit regression test suite to install a beta version in public on surface if all the tests pass (we may need to relax this since the test suite frequently fails and this may result in it not getting updated for a long time. Perhaps having the serial tests pass or having it build successfully would be good enough). The launch script will also need updating since currently the user would need to do a ""module load cudatoolkit/6.0"" before being able to run it so that VisIt can pick up the cuda libraries.

If you do stereo saves in family mode, you get two images, one for left and one for right eye. The left eye is always first.
If you happen to be starting from an odd number in the family, it will mean you get odd=left, even=right. If you happen to start from an even number, you get odd=right, even=left (the opposite).
I think it might be best if it always enforced odd number for left and even number for right. Certainly would lead to lower possible confusion.

It is frequently the case that objects sometimes change in size over time or more in space over time. It would be nice to have an option that has visit keep the object in the center of the view. This would be added as one of the options for ""View based on"" on the Advanced tab on the View window. There is already an ""actual spatial extents"" option and perhaps that should just be made to work.
Willy Moss wanted such a feature and I used the spatial extents query to get the actual limits of the mesh to set the the view. He would like a more automated feature in VisIt to do that.

The new ""Save session"" dialog has some usability issues:
1. The placement of the filename and filter above the directory and file lists does not match what system file dialogs. Many system dialogs place the filename under any directory or file lists that might be present. Typically, the filter is found down there too. It would make more sense to move filename and filter to the bottom of the window and make filter a combo box with just ""*.session"" in it. I liked the system dialog we were using to save session previously and would like to see the new one be a closer match for usability's sake.
2. The old behavior was to make a default filename that would be put into the file dialog in case the user wanted to just name the file ""visit1.session"" or whatever it made up. The new dialog just presents an empty filename and the widget does not have focus. I'd like the default added back in with the filename widget getting focus and the text in the filename line edit highlighted so the next character I type will override the whole filename.

I was writing a test case for template movies and ran into some problems with the files that were output from visit_composite. That's the program that assembles different viewports and does transitions and compositing effects. The program was recently changed to use VTK to write out files to remove a non-portable dependency on ImageMagick.
1. When I exported the template movie to MPEG, the PNG files that were produced choked ffmpeg on surface.2. When I exported the template movie to TIFF, VisIt could not read in the resulting TIFF images and complained about adding 0's to pad the data array.3. When I exported the template movie to BMP and PNG, VisIt could not faithfully draw the images I expected. I often got white, black, or red for the whole image.
I'm guessing that alpha is getting written out -- or something weird like that.
I ended up having to add a call to ""convert"" in the test case to make valid PNGs that VisIt likes. It would be good to correct 1-3 above and fix the test5 function in the movie.py test case so convert is no longer needed. Verify that template movies can make MPEG movies with ffmpeg.

I opened trunk version of VisIt on linux, opened curv2d.silo add plot.  Lots of weirdness ensued.
1) 'Active course' shows full path, where before the Session dialog changes, I think it only added full path if more than 1 source, and they had different paths.
2) After I add a plot, 'Replace' and  'overlay' become active, even though I only have 1 source.
3) Delete plot, 'active source' no longer really active, cannot add another plot without clicking 'reopen'
4) After clicking 'reopen' to re-activate the source, and add a new plot, 'Add' for plots becomes greyed out.
5) expanding '~' with 'visit -o' results in bad path:There was an error opening /home/biagas2/Branches/CleanTrunk/trunk/Build/binh/home/biagas2/visit/data/curv2d.silo. It may be an invalid file.  VisIt tried using the following file format readers to open the file: <No suitable plugins were identified>  Actually, '-o' doesn't work even with full path.
I think these are all related to the recent Save Session dialog changes.

The new save session dialog uses the 'cwd' path by default.  Used to be the location where visit started (on linux) and users' visit home directory on windows.
eg, if I open curv2d in /usr/gapps/visit/data, then save session will open that location for the path by default, this adds an extra step for saving on local systems, I now have to change the path.
On Windows, this is especially bad if the 'cwd' is non write-able.
I think the old defaults should be restored:
For windows: VISITUSERHOMEFor linux: VISITHOME (I think is what we used to do).

Kathleen reported that the export_db.py test was failing on Windows because it tried to remove files that were open in the engine. I added the appropriate CloseDatabase() calls to the test to try and make it more Windows-friendly. Things seemed okay until I ran the test case in parallel. In parallel, the presence of certain CloseDatabase() calls causes the engine to crash while processing the load balancing for the CMFE. This happens on Mac and Linux. I commented out all the CloseDatabase() lines in export_db.py for the time-being. This bug should be considered done when the engine does not crash in parallel and the export_db.py test passes in parallel with the calls to CloseDatabase().

Here is an e-mail from a user about his experiences with building VisIt.
Hi,
Just a comment comment, and a question:
Comment: it is really confusing for a user if two installations of visit have a plugin for xdmf, but one of them opens the file fine (contains a temporal collection), while the other does not. Now, with some research I found out why (the xdmf library was not built into one, and because of that the (previous) visit xdmf reader was used). I would suggest to make the distinction between the two a little more clear, to avoid users stumbling over this.
Question: Are the build-commands (in particular for svn_bin/build_visit) for the released versions available some place? This could have saved me quite many recompiles.
thanks, Frank

We occasionally have users that use build_visit to build visit for servers and they don't necessarily know to add --mesa as an option to include mesa. We should improve the discussion on building visit with build_visit to discuss this.

2396,Pending,Bug,High, Incorrect rendering of arbitrary polyhedral meshes ,-,-,-,Daryl Hawkins,09/25/2015,,0%,,09/25/2015 11:54 am,10/08/2015 01:30 pm,3 - Occasional,3 - Major Irritation,2.9.2,,,All,Any,"
We are generating a polyhedral mesh that's a polygonal mesh extruded in the third dimension.  If we write a ucd mesh using silo's DBPutZonelist2 method, VisIt fails to correctly render polyhedra with more than 6 sides.  We always end up with missing mesh lines.  If, instead of DBPutZonelist2, we use DBPutPHZonelist, the 3D mesh rendering looks correct, but a 2D slice includes extra internal structure that shouldn't be there.  Looking at the internal mesh reveals what appear to be tetrahedral structures that include vertices that are not part of the true mesh.  It would also appear that some of this structure is being projected onto the 2D slice.  An example silo file is included.

2397,New,Bug,Normal, audit proper handling of DB_F77NULL in silo_f.c ,-,-,-,Mark Miller,09/28/2015,,0%,,09/28/2015 05:04 pm,,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,4.8,,,All,Any,"
A user at LANL ran into this with fortran code.
He passed DB_F77NULL for 'meshtypes' in a dbputmm call. That is because he wanted to specify constant block type with DBOPT_MB_BLOCK_TYPE optlist option.
Well, that didn't work. Both drivers still wrote out a garbage meshtypes array. Why? Because in silo_f.c, for cases like this, we need to test the value in the first entry of the array for DB_F77NULL and if we find it, turn around and pass NULL to the C call. We do this in several places but I am concerned we don't do it everywhere we need to.
We need to audit silo_f.c for these cases and confirm they are all handled.
This involves finding all the places in Silo's API where a caller can pass DB_F77NULL to indicate an non-existent array and then ensure we actually test for *array == DB_F77NULL and pass 0 (or NULL) for equivalent arg in the C call.

There are some Silo files with many dirs that VisIt takes too long to open.
This is likely due to performance of DBGetToc.
Can we implement a GetDirTree option that returns an entire directory tree perhaps with also a filter for dirs that must contain certain kinds of objects? In HDF5 driver, should be easy.

Add an option to VisIt to allow server-side image saves. In the event of multiple engines, the destination engine would need to be selectable and the image should be composited on the viewer and sent to the engine to write it out. If there is a single engine then the image save could happen directly on the engine.
This would help address an issue with saving images from Libsim when connected interactively client/server. Calls to VisItSaveWindow() do different things depending on whether there is a viewer connection or whether Libsim is being used in batch mode. When interactive connections are used, Libsim sends a message to the viewer to tell it to save the window. The viewer ends up getting an image from the simulation and saving it client-side. We'd like to be able to save server-side as is done in batch mode.
Done:1. When VisIt can save an image server-side.2. When an interactive connection to the updateplots simulation can save its images server-side.

avtVTKWriter::WriteRootFile fails crashes parallel because the fileNames vector used only represents the local processor's filenames rather than the fileNames generated on all ranks.

For the 2.9.x series, we moved the ""-forceversion"" to the front of the options instead of the back when calling programs. Makemili takes the first unknown option as the file name. This leads to makemili getting the following execute line ""makemili -forceversion 2.9.0 filename"". Makemili ignores the ""-forceversion"" since it starts with a dash and then interprets the 2.9.0 as the filename, which is wrong. This makes makemili unusable.

But, ~5,000 variables were getting populated. The open took a while. Then, literally any operation in the gui, adding a plot, deleting a plot, hiding a plot, etc. would trigger a VariableMenuPopulator::UpdateVariableList call which is on the order of several seconds. I think a lot of this work can be done once per timestep and then cached so we don't wind up having to re-do it each time we change something in the GUI.

I'm am brand new to Visit and appear to be running into the same problem using version 2.9.2.  I'm working on adding the ability to write HDF5 files out from a CFD code (multi-block, structured, overset) and want to be able to read these files into Visit.  While exploring the XDMF path to accomplish this I've run into the problem described in the original post.
If I place each block in top-level grid elements I can individually add mesh plots for each block.  Since the number of blocks can typically be on the order of 100 this approach doesn't seem practical.  So, I attempted to create an outer Grid element of type Tree as shown in xdmf file below.  However, when I attempt to draw the mesh for the grid named ""All"" (The top-level Tree type grid) I get the same message described in the original post, ""The source object specified is invalid.""

I just noticed that when we do debug builds with build_visit, we build all the TPLs with -g too. It seems a bit overkill.
I rarely need to descend into TPL code to debug issues. I mean, it does happen sometimes with Silo for example. But, its rare. I could see it being more useful in our core TPLs like Qt or VTK.
Does it make sense to propogate a debug build of VisIt to all its TPLs? Not sure its too easy to change as I think it involves visiting all the bv_xxx.sh files to fix.
What if someone plays it safe, first does a debug build with build_visit and then after confirming everything is working, does a release build but without removing the TPLs? I think build_visit will just use those then. And, they'll be getting -g versions of those builds (and perhaps without -DNDEBUG too which is potentially worse).

Hi everyone,
I just tried to compile VisIt 2.10.0 on BlueGene/Q and came across the following bug.SILO fails in ""configure"" when checking for H5open
The reason is the switch from HDF5 1.8.7 to 1.8.14.HDF5 now requires dlopen(and friends) to compile.
On BlueGene/Q you have to link any HDF5 application now with an additional ""-ldl"" to resolve these commands.
SILO compiles if I change the lines beginning with 28865 in ""configure"" to         LIBS=""-lhdf5 -lsz -ldl $LIBS""       else         LIBS=""-lhdf5 -ldl $LIBS"" But this might not be a final solution.

I tried to write a fortran code where arrays were declared using 2D fortran syntax and then write a quadmesh and material object.
I ran into problems between non-collinear and collinear cases. Its very peculiar and non-inutitve.
It no doubt has to do with row-major vs. col-major storage orderings. But, getting both cases to work correctly is totally counter-intuitive. It makes me think that there may be a number of funky issues in using the fortran interface for real 2D arrays (probably only relevant to quad objects).

Hi everyone,
VisIt engine cannot connect back to viewer, if login-node is known by different names and IPs for external connections (clients) and internal connections (compute nodes).
The problem has been discussed on the ""VisIt - User Mailing List"" and Brad suggested a fix:https://elist.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-users/2015-October/017961.htmlThis fix works perfect on the JUQUEEN and I hope it can become part of the official VisIt release.
It introduces the command line argument ""-socket-bridge-host"" to set the socket bridge host instead of using ""gethostname(""localhost"").
Attached you find the implementation in common/comm/LaunchService.C for VisIt version 2.9.2.It works fine on the BlueGene/Q JUQUEEN at Juelich Research Centre in Germany.

I created a simple Fortran Silo test code writing a quadmesh and material both with non-collinear and collinear coordinates using 2D fortran arrays. Very confusing behavior
The non-collinear case seems to work fine. I understand both the fortran code to produce it and what I am seeing in VisIt and they both agree.
However, the collinear case is very bizarre. The fortran code to write it is a bit funny (thats another story) and VisIt seems to display it strangely.
The variabes are qmesh/mat and qmeshcl/matcl (for collinear case)

First, plotting the two meshes results in different default view in VisIt. I have no idea why. Both meshes are identical as far as geometry. But, VisIt displays the collinear case squashed in Y direction.
Next, I am unable to pick on the clean zones. I get pick didn't intersect surface. But, this happens only for the clean zones.
Next, I am unable to pick any node on the collinear mesh
Label plot of zone/node ids seems to display what I would expect
After I've done something like a material selection (or maybe just the label plot), then I can pick on clean zones. However, it returns the same zone idea for both of the left most zones, a different id but both same for the middle two zones and a different but same id for both right-most zones (0, 1, 2)

There maybe nothing wrong with VisIt here. The problem(s) may all be a result of the Silo file and dealing with row-major vs. col-major storage issues between fortran and C.
I've attached the file and the fortran code.

Hi Visit-team,
I am going to make heavy use of the histogram plot option from visit. However, I feel a little restricted with the provided options of data binning. As the binning is effectively a smoothing it takes a lot of testing to figure out a good value for it. It would be nice if the code could use an adaptive technique like the one proposed here:https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/12/dynamic-programming-in-python/The link already includes a python example how to implement the requested feature.

Hi,
I came across a problem using libsimV2+Fortran+visitgetenv().
It is about the line 427 in visitfortransimV2interface.c:    sz = (len < *lenv) ? (sz - 1) : (*lenv - 1);
IMHO, it should look like this:    sz = (len < *lenv) ? (len) : (sz - 1);
From Fortran I call visitgetenv() like this:      character(len=4096) :: env      integer :: env_len = 4096      if (mpi_proc_id == 0) then        ierr = visItGetEnv(env,env_len); CHKWARN1      end if
Hence, it has to ensured, that the string written to env must not be larger than env_len.   In  visitgetenv() the string to copy is 'src' and its length 'len'.
=> if 'len' is smaller than '*lenv', we can use memcpy to fill 'env'.else we should not copy anything to 'env'.

I was looking into an issue with the csg test on windows, so was trying to follow the steps from the test script via the gui.In particular, these MeshManagement settings:mma=MeshManagementAttributes()mma.discretizationMode = mma.Adaptivemma.discretizationTolerance=(0.01, 0.25)SetMeshManagementAttributes(mma)
1) In the gui 'Adaptive' is not selectable.
EDIT: This is due to my removal of BOOST from the windows build. Will fix.
2) There doesn't appear to be a control for setting 'discretizationTolerance'.
EDIT: This is the 'Smallest zone' and 'Flat enough' controls.  Kind of confusing, IMHO.   Plus the cli seems to allow 3 entries (see full atts from cli below).
3) 'Don't discretize' greyed out in gui, but settable via cli.
Here are the full MeshManagementAttributes from the cli:

Hi everyone,
if one calls a C-function from Fortran and it includes a CHARACTER argumentFortran will call that function with an additional hidden argument for the length of the CHARACTER at the end of the argument list(as long as you are not using BIND, which is part of Fortran2003).Example: CHARACTER :: name = ""foo""   INTEGER :: arg2, arg3  [...]  call foo_C_function(name, arg2, arg3)Required function definition in C-lib:  void foo_C_function(char* name, int* arg2, int* arg3, int name_f77len)
Currently this is not considered in the VisIt Fortran interface.Hence, with each function call from Fortran to VisIt an additional int is written to the stack, which is not expected. This can lead to unexpected errors, which are hard to track.
It can be solved for all functions defined in visitfortransimV2interface.c easily.I attached a fix, which works fine for me. It changes all function definitions expecting on or more CHARACTER arguments in Fortran.Example:
FORTRANF_VISITSETDIRECTORY(VISIT_F77STRING dir, VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN(dir) int *ldir VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN(dir))
with VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN and VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN defined in VisItFortran.h like this:
#ifdef USE_VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN(a)   ,int a ## _f77hiddenlen#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN_DECL ,int#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN(a)#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN_DECL#else#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN(a)#define VISIT_F77_MIXED_STRLEN_DECL#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN(a)     ,int a ## _f77hiddenlen#define VISIT_F77_END_STRLEN_DECL   ,int#endif
This is the common approach for Fortran77 interfaces you can find for example in MPICH:http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/repos/snowflock/mpich-1.2.7/mpid/ch_nt/nt_ipvishm/include/mpidefs.h MPI_GET_PROCESSOR_NAME( char * FORT_MIXED_LEN_DECL, MPI_Fint *, MPI_Fint * FORT_END_LEN_DECL );http://sourcecodebrowser.com/mpich2/1.2.1/mpi__fortimpl_8h_source.html #define FORT_MIXED_LEN_DECL, #define FORT_END_LEN_DECL
more:
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Argument-passing-conventions.html
 * Microsoft Fortran adds the argument not at the end, but just after the CHARACTER arg - hence, FORT_MIXED_LEN_* is also provided, but just for completeness.

PF3D reader returns zero for the time and cycle for all but the first time state accessed in a time sequence.

Curve plot has an option to cycle the color (eg each new curve plot gets created with a different color).
If this option is ON, and you select multiple curves to change a different option (say 'show points'), then the color for all the selected curves gets changed as well.
Listed as Major Irritiation becuase Al had many plots up, and going back into each one individually to change the color after the operation was a pain.

A small, but highly confusing issue. Silo comes packaged with a number of preset conf files in config-site/*.conf, and will any that match the current machines hostname.
In particular there is a config-site/localhost.conf (links to delenn.conf) which explicitly sets the fortran compiler to g77.
It is very common that a machine will not have an explicit hostname set, especially on virtual machines.On these machines silo will not configure without explicitly overriding the ""FC"" environment variable.I'm sure you have some reasons for loading settings based on hostname, but maybe consider removing those conf files from the release tarball?

Decomposition of polyhedra is handled by the underlying vtk reader.  It is an option that is ON by default.However, it doesn't serve up to VisIt the necessary information for proper reconstruction of mesh lines (avtOriginalCells/Nodes, etc), so mesh plots can have too many esh lines showing the decomposition.
If I turn OFF the vtk reader option, some portions of VisIt's pipeline may crash.
The OpenFOAM reader should be modified to pass along the necessary information for reconstructing the original polyhedral cells.  Either pull the decomp out of the vtk reader into avt, or modify the vtk to serve these visit-isms.
Or should all of this be handled in the transform manager instead of the readers? (Silo does its own decomp).

I was running on Sierra.  Had saved settings I didn't want to use for a particular session, so ran visit with '-noconfig'.  But I still needed a host profile for sierra to run in parallel, so I used the Options->Host Profiles->Remote profiles mechanisms for importing only the sierra profile.  When I tried to save settings, the viewer segv'd.  I next tried same thing, but removed my .visit directory.  Same segv.  If I don't try to import a sessionfile, but change some other setting then save, then the viewer does not segv.  I have used this mechanism for importing a host profile many times in the past and have never had a problem saving my settings.

Hi,
That sounds like an issue with large file support in Silo (files larger than 4GB). We should be able to handle such files. Perhaps the Silo library associated with the version was improperly compiled. Can you tell me what versions and platforms this failed on (and if you built it yourself or used one of our pre-built versions from the web site)?
Thanks,
Eric

Reported by Michael Pozulp and Matt O'Brien
This has to do with VisIt's handling of time varying metadata. By default, it assumes md is time INvariant. So, objects that appear and disappear in Silo files in a sequence present problems.
The solution is to sometimes write empty objects so that the objects are always there and just sometimes empty.
However, I still don't think a plot object expecting to be backed up by real data from a database is going to react correctly when it has data on some timesteps and not on others.

We generate some scalar variables for convenience, all vector magnitudes and mesh_quality metrics (about 25 of those) for ucd meshes.
Well, these scalar variables then wind up getting treated by StatisticalTrends submenus too so that we define 6 x (2+25) variables whenever we have a ucd mesh.
This business of pre-defining variables is getting out of hand, bloating our metadata and contributing to GUI sluggishness.

.visit files that were generated on Windows (i.e. that contain CR, \r newline characters) fail to open in VisIt on Linux. An error message is printed in the Information window that says ""This database cannot handle more than 0 files"".
This bug is very easy to reproduce on Linux - just run unix2dos on a .visit file and then try opening it.
It appears that a change in behavior was introduced between VisIt versions 2.7.3 and 2.8.0 and persists until the current version.
I have tracked down the source of the bug to avtDatabase::GetFileListFromTextFile in src/avt/Database/Database/avtDatabase.C and I have a fix that works on Linux. I will commit it to the repository.

I am working under the assumption that the 'origin point' for slice simply defines the plane.
However, changing it from (0,0,0) actually translates the plot by the value in the origin point.First slice, shows 0,1,0,1 expected extents in x and y.Second slice, after only changing origin point to (0, 0.2, 0), now the plot is shifted down by .2 in y, showing extents 0,1, -0.2, 0.8
If you don't project to 2d, then the extents are correct, despite the origin change.

In a time series, its possible that some plotted objects don't exist in all states. As a user moves through states, if a plot is associated with an object that doesn't exist in that state, the plot is sent into an error state and an error message is generated.
There are many things that can cause plots to go into error states. The case of the data associated with the plot not being present in the current state is kind of a special one that I think requires some special handling. First, its quite common. Second, its quite annoying for users to deal with. An error popup always occurs and there is no way to disable it.
That said, in other respects, VisIt seems able to continue moving through time and even recover an error'd plot when the data for it because available again in a later state.
So, maybe all that is required here is to change how we handle this one special kind of situation from an Error to a Warning (which can be disabled but nonetheless, a user can still go to the output window to see whats happened if the ever need to). As well, maybe instead of turning the plot red in the plot list (en error) turn it to some other color, maybe orange or blue or something to indicate it isn't so much in Error as it is there isn't data for it in the current state.

There is no way to clear the contents of the output window.
AFAIK from a brief eye-ball of the code, the window just appends messages forever. When doing time-series with missing plots, that window can wind up getting a lot lines appended to it.
It would be nice to have a button to clear its contents.
Sometimes, for debugging, its nice to separate output so that when when you scroll back through it, you can find breaks in operations. So, it would also be nice to have a button to add a separator line (maybe with a number)
We should probably have a maximum number of lines and if so, we may need to make it user-adjustable via some kind of setting.

Talked to a guy at MIT that is using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a test and SAS (Software as a Service) enviornment. I think we should consider same with VisIt. We can build OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, RedHat and Windows instances there (no OS X instances yet). And, using their Spot (as opposed to On Demand tier of service), costs are pennies per CPU hour. I think we can do wider scope of VisIt testing in that context and even offer running, parallel VisIt instances which might be aweseome for situations like Tutorials/ATPESC where we have such a diversity of (student's) machines to deal with.

We can't have stat() calls in VisIt. we should use VisItStat everywhere. This is to ensure we a) code is portable to multiple platforms and b) handles large files.
There are probably other examples of cases where VisIt code should always use some VisIt specific wrapper method that naive developers could easily not be aware of.
What about adding a new hook to catch instances of this?
It would be general enough that it would specify a table of some common function names like 'stat' and specify its intended replacement names, 'VisItStat' and the hook would simply fail the commit and notify users they need to replace the first with the second.

Hi Eric,
It looks like you own the VisIT builds in /usr/gapps/visit on LC machines. Let me know if this should be going somewhere else though. I took a call from a user yesterday who has an older version of VisIT (2.7.3) on his desktop. He was trying to start a compute engine on rzzeus from VisIT on his desktop, but VisIT would hang when he tried to start it. There was an error on the console:
/usr/gapps/visit/2.7.3/linux-x86_64/bin/viewer: error while loading shared libraries: libMagick++.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
I can reproduce the behavior by running /usr/gapps/visit/bin/legacylauncher -v 2.7.3 on rzzeus. I asked the user to move to a newer version of VisIT on his desktop, but I thought I'd also check in with you about whether the older versions of VisIT could be relinked against more recent versions of libMagick++.

When using the threshold operator with a scatter plot created from curve data (from a csv file), using the 'Zones from input' option gives weird results.
Here is how I can reproduce the issue:
- The source data is a csv file with three columns that correspond to x_coordinate, y_coordinate and a value.- I open the csv file using the Plaintext reader. I DO NOT use the option to specify columns 0 and 1 as the x and y coordinates.- I then create an expression called 'unnamed1' with Definition 'var02'. This will be used for thresholding.- I create a scatter plot using var00 and var01 as x and y, and var02 as the Color Variable.- I then apply a threshold operator using the scalar 'unnamed1'.- When applying the threshold operator, there is an option to output mesh as 'Zones from input' or 'Point mesh'.  - When using the 'Zones from input' option, the threshold operator outputs weird results.  - Changing the output to 'Point mesh' gives expected results.
When opening the file, if I use the options of the Plaintext reader to specify that columns 0 and 1 are the x and y coordinates, VisIt creates a point mesh and the thresholding works fine with both threshold output options ('Zones from input' or 'Point mesh').
- I have created a simple .csv file and .session file that reproduces the issue.- The .session file contains two plots, one that thresholds using 'Zones from input' the other using 'Point mesh'.- The thresholded plots are different
Having to tick the 'Point Mesh' button in the threshold dialog is not a big deal, but I have encountered some plots where the incorrect method has been used without realising that the output was wrong.

Currently, our curve plots support a single horizontal axis (at the bottom) and a single verticle axis (at the top).
However, a lot of comparative scientific results involve plotting two curves relative to each other. However, those two curves often require different y axes (one on the left and a different one on the right) and in rare cases two different X axes (one on the bottom and one on the top).
I think this is just a swizzle on our current curve plot and does not require a new plot.

From Eric Galtier on the user's list
Im not sure if this should be interpreted as a bug which, in this case should be reported to the other mailing list but, the problem I had below seems to come from a problem in the reading/interpretation of the command in the expression window. Basically, when I try
pos_cmfe(<l332_3D_hdf5_plt_cnt_0020:te>, amr_mesh, te)-te
I got the error mentionned below, but when I write it:
te-pos_cmfe(<l332_3D_hdf5_plt_cnt_0020:te>, amr_mesh, te)
the expression is evaluated and gives the right answer. This is on VisIt 2.10.0 installed on a Mac running 10.11.3 OS X version. It looks like anytime I try to compute an expression starting from the pos_cmfe command, it crashes the compute engine.

Hi Eric,
thanks for answering. Both the ideas would be good for me, because what I would like to see is where the streamlines are pointing, and having the arrows only at the end sometimes is confusing, especially if a lot of the streamlines end in the same point or in a small zone.Does it sound reasonable?ThanksGB

Thats not possible in VisIt, the only option is to have them at the end. I can add an enhancement request for what you have described. I notice that in the python example that there appears to be a single arrow in each streamline, roughly in the center of the streamline (some are clearly closer to the beginning, so it isnt just the center of each line). Is that what you are after, or are you interested in multiple arrows on each streamline, spaced equally along the streamline at some interval?

I think this is becoming a more common case; a database with many thousands of variables. In addition, auto-gen of expressions exacerbates the problem.
The GUI becomse bogged down and even processing metadata is problematic.
On top of that, we have a gremlin or two in the database open process that can case the opened database to be closed (forcing the user to have to re-open) or to not properly open the file.

We have a cmake script that combines a bunch of VisIt libraries together into a single libsimV2_static_par.a file that can be used in simulations. There are a few things wrong with the VisIt build that prevent easily using this library to build the example simulations.
1. When Mesa is present, we build a libvisit_vtk_osmesa.a library. When present, that library should be folded into the libsimV2_static_*.a files.2. Change the example sim CMakeLists.txt to add ICET to the link line when ICET is present -- not just under BG/Q.3. Change the example sim CMakeLists.txt to add Mesa to the link line when needed (follow logic in tools/diagnostics/osmesa).4. We still may run into issues if MPI is not added last.

When static Libsim support was added, it wasn't seen as a big deal that we'd not include regular VisIt database plugins into the Libsim static library. After all, we were going to do rendering and write images in situ. Unfortunately, this prevents simulations from exporting to useful formats. I added in VTK support so we can at least export to VTK but there are other useful ones we're missing such as Silo. Adding Silo would mean that applications would have to link with it and this gets complicated fast for a bunch of formats. Including the database plugins into the static Libsim would be straightforward (edit CMake/CreateStaticSimV2.cmake.in and then sim/V2/runtime/StaticSymbolLocator.C). Maybe what we can do is make an options script that can be installed with VisIt that provides the big list of libraries, etc needed to link a static libsim application so we can do something like this:
gcc -o mysim mysim.c `libsim-config`
That would expand to a whole lot of stuff, with libraries linked against the installed VisIt's (and VTK and Silo and Mesa and IceT, ...) .a's / .so's

3) Show using box, clip, slice to only read blocks of interest, rather that explicitly listing them. Only works with readers that provide limits (figure out which readers support this, Silo obviously does).
4) When taking about using MIR and not setting to always, the question came up about why you would want to always turn on MIR. We didn't have a good example, we should figure out one from our data and include it in the tutorial.
5) We should create a time savers 2 tutorial and move the notes to it and the content on saving state and macros to it.
6) Another item for the time savers could be python callbacks.

This is for Engineering users at LLNL. Note that a key part of Engineering users interaction with VisIt is through a python script they have developed called GrizIt. The python GrizIt script is designed to allow engineering users to use Griz commands they are familiar with to interact with VisIt.
The new Mili plugin will serve up in PopulateDatabaseMetadata strings for stress variable such as ""sx"". But, for Mili users, the stress variable may be available at a large variety of different integration points. For example, the data producer may compute stress at 40 integration points. It may save to a Mili file say only the values for 5 of those integration points, say 1,2,3, 15 and 37. A user plotting ""sx"" variable will get the values for its default (maybe first defined) integration point. However, a user using GrizIt or VisIt's expression system could construct a string, say ""sx,3"" (or maybe ""sx~3"" or ""sx3"" or some other syntax that does not collide with expression system or potentially cause other problems in VisIt) which means to plot the variable ""sx"" for the integration point 3. This string will NOT pass VisIt sanity checks for either it being a valid variable or for other things that avtDatabaseMetadata my wind up trying to perform on the string. So, the idea here is to adjust the sanity checking logic for variable names in VisIt to ignore all characters in a variable name after some sentinel or between some delimiter chars (e.g. guard chars) In our example, integration point 3 exists in the Mili file. The point is that the extra characters in the variable name are understood by the plugin. The plugin can do the right thing given the string. But, we don't want these extra characters to effect anything else in VisIt. We just want VisIt to pass the whole string along to the plugin with the understanding that the plugin will know what to do with the extra stuff in the string. If the requested integration point is not available, either the plugin can through an invalid variable exception or opt to select the closest available. However, in the latter case, its important to warn the user that the requested integration point was not returned and then also tell the user what actual integration point was used. This latter bit of messaging may be achievable via warnings from the plugin or may require some additional enhancement for the plugin to send textual information to the user.
Its conceivable the sentinel or delimiter chars chosen here could be specified by the database itself. In other words, we add a field to avtDatabaseMetadata indicating the guard char and allow the database to select chars other than the default if desired.

This is for Engineering users at LLNL. Note that a key part of Engineering users interaction with VisIt is through a python script they have developed called GrizIt. The python GrizIt script is designed to allow engineering users to use Griz commands they are familiar with to interact with VisIt.
At present, there is no adopted way to get information back to users regarding some aspect of the database they have opened. Some degree of messaging is currently achieved by a combination of, File Information (which is basically a textual realization of avtDatabaseMetaData), graying out of variables in the GUI, and exception/warning messages. One example may be Mili library version number.
For information that is associated with the database as a whole, its possible we could support a more general, arbitrary text object as an extension of the already existing functionality for the database comment field. This approach may not be sufficient however because its associated only with the database itself and doesn't provide messaging that can vary in response to different GetMesh/GetVar calls issued on a database plugin.
So, another route to go here is to support adding generalized textual information on vtkDataArray and vtkDataset objects returned from a plugin. VisIt can inspect the returned objects and if it finds attached to these objects some ""avtMessageInfo"" object (or some such thing), do the work to push the string either to the ''output"" window or as a separate popup dialog.

This is for Engineering users at LLNL. Note that a key part of Engineering users interaction with VisIt is through a python script they have developed called GrizIt. The python GrizIt script is designed to allow engineering users to use Griz commands they are familiar with to interact with VisIt.
VisIt's notion of global node and zone ids is confined to a 1-tuple of arbitrary (but typically 32 or 64 bit integral) type. We need to generalize this notion to an n-tuple of arbitrary types. In the conext of Mili, n would be 2. The first component would be a Mili class id, super class or class name (as strings) and the second component would be the number of the element in that collection.
Note that this impacts several spots in the GUI where users have the option of typing in global ids. My suggestion, to make this modification simple, is to simply enhance these text box entries to support space, comma, semicolon and tab delimited values. The first value would be interpreted as the first component of the n-tuple, the 2nd value for the second component, etc. Finally, searches within mesh datastructures to find the node/zone specified by the n-tuple also would need to be enhanced to deal with multi-component matching.
Its concievable that one might want a 2-tuple consisting of a 'char' for the first component and an 'int' for the second. If that proves to be problematic however, its probably ok to assume all components of the n-tuple are the same type.

We would like to enhance pick to print a string near the picked node or zone which might look like or ""Node: 25 (72 bar)"", Mili class name, label-id (a number) and then the active variable value.
It might be nice for this string to be user-customizeable with sprintf-like syntax. For examle, the string ""Node: %n, %N (%v)"" would mean to print ""Node: <local-node-number> <global-node-number> (<variable-value>)""
If the active variable changes, the variable value's text should update to the new active variable. This is probably the hard part.
A majority of the functionality here is kinda sorta already part of the label plot. So, we might wanna ask why adding some functionality to the label plot to display values on only specific nodes/zones isn't the right answer.

We may want to maintan a stack of recently entered pick strings that represents each group of picks and which can be easily toggled on/off or deleted. On the other hand, a simple toggle may be sufficient here to turn on and off picked/selected nodes/zones. Otherwise, next to the text box where the string specifying the picked/selected zones we could have two buttons, one to use the string to pick/select, the other to use the string to UNpick/UNselect.

The ability to save some 3D formats during a Save Window opration is often confusing to users. This is especially true since an Export Database operation can do a generally better job of this already. However, curve formats during a Save Window operation are very convenient. Generally, curves can never overwhelm the viewer whereas STL or OBJ saves could easily overwhelm the viewer. We have some problems with the current interface. Save Window is NOT saving a window if you save a curve or stl format. Save window saves only from client whereas export database saves from server. Both are essentially save operations of some kind but one is named 'save' and the other 'export'.


We recommend re-design where there is just a single 'Save' or 'Save Output' dialog with the following options
	
choice to save on machine where client is running or where server is running.
choice to merge results to N files where N can be one
	
This would likely necessitate the introduction of a merge operator/filter
Note that a merge to a single object/file requires one of the following. . .
	
dataset is small enough to merge to a single engine core
output format supports appends

OpenDatabase(""localhost:D:\VisItClass2016\data\noise.silo"", 0)
AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""hardyglobal"", 1, 0)
DrawPlots()

When I deleted the plot, closed the database, and ran the recorded code, VisIt complained:
ERROR: VisIt could not read from the file ""D:\VisItClass2016\data
oise.silo"".

The generated error message was:

There was an error opening D:\VisItClass2016\data
oise.silo. It may be an invalid file.  VisIt tried using the following file format readers to open the file: <No suitable plugins were identified>

The following error(s) may be helpful in identifying the problem:
The file ""D:\VisItClass2016\data
oise.silo"" does not exist.

ERROR: Cannot create a plot until a database has been opened.

It would appear that the backslash+'n' were interpreted as an end of line and caused the file read to fail. The solution is to audit the Python command recording in the CLI so that filenames that contain backslashes get backslashes escaped. When I make those corrections to the code in the Commands window, that allows it to run.

We have a bug in the MFEM/VisIt integration that prevents us from visualizing high-order Nedelec elements on tet meshes.
Cyrus: the problem is in line 462 of VisIts src/databases/MFEM/avtMFEMFileFormat.C.
Can you switch   mesh = new Mesh(imesh, 1, 1);to   mesh = new Mesh(imesh, 1, 1, false);
The fix_orientation argument is true by default in this constructor, because it makes sense when we use the mesh for discretization. For visualization, this is actually wrong in the high-order Nedelec case.

I used VisIt scripting to partition a large dataset into smaller pieces using the Box operator and I exported the pieces to Silo. I then wanted to use the NBLOCKS directive in the .visit file so I could plot the whole thing. The !NBLOCKS directive didn't work. It worked though when I saved to VTK. So, I had to export to VTK and then read the .visit file and export to Silo, causing a 2 step process.

I get unruly data from CFD file formats and there are often variable names we would think are strange (e.g. ""some name [package]""). While it is often possible to plot these variables in VisIt, exporting to Silo doesn't work often because the Silo library complains about the variable name and stops the export. Why does Silo have to use the variable name directly when constructing its HDf5 array names, etc? Why not in this case, have Silo munge the name to something valid and then do translation internally when asked for the variable name that the user likes?

I was recently doing in situ runs on titan and using the ProgrammableCompositor because I didn't use IceT (IceT performance was bad) and the images that popped out were incorrect. When I enabled the class' debugging features to write out some VTK data, I saw that the Z buffers were right but the colors were not. I figured this had to be due to some incorrect vectorization. I replaced restrict directives with a bogus empty RESTRICT macro to prevent the compiler from being able to vectorize (it needs the restrict keyword to know that the data is not aliased). When I did that, the saved images were correct.

While doing some in situ rendering tests at scale, I found that IceT compositing was taking the bulk of the time. I wasn't too surprised there but the scale of the time was a surprise because it was really bad. Out of desperation, I switched to the Programmable compositor and got okay performance. I'm still wondering whether IceT can do better if we change how VisIt uses it.
I'm not sure whether this has always been the case but the way VisIt uses IceT doesn't scale whatsoever. The basic problem seems to be that VisIt doesn't take advantage of its knowledge of which ranks have data to exclude ranks from the compositing. The ProgrammableCompositor uses that information to only involve ranks with data in the compositing process. For IceT, we should use that information to split the communicator so we have one that just includes ranks that have data.

Have a look at PV to see what they do with IceT as they apparently don't have this problem.
Refactor VisIt code to use IceT better (comm splitting, etc)
Update to IceT 2.1
Run at scale into 40K-100K processor range (maybe cori for 40k or vulcan for 100k)
Compare timings against IceT and ProgrammableCompositor
If ProgrammableCompositor is still faster than IceT, dump IceT from VisIt since it adds build pain anyway

I might have a look at this in a few weeks if nobody can get to it.

When I made a statically linked Libsim application, the startup time for Libsim was on the order of a few seconds still. Initially, this was because I was still doing calls to spawn a ""visit -env -engine"" to set up environment. Even after ditching that and doing putenv() calls myself in the application, the startup cost was still surprisingly high. I ran out to large scale and saw that the initialization time worsened with scale. Static Libsim initialization ought to be very fast since it's not loading a runtime library or plugins. Is Libsim still reading some config files, etc? Maybe we need to build statically and run under strace.

I needed to use static Libsim from a simulation. I wanted to use cmake to detect Libsim instead of having to add a bunch of stuff to the simulation's cmake. I devised a LIBSIMConfig.cmake file that can be used with FIND_PACKAGE. I put that file into install_static/2.11.0/linux-x86_64/libsim/V2/lib.  We should make it better and include it with the Libsim install. It's currently geared towards Libsim static where we need to know about VisIt, VTK, GL, IceT dependencies in order to link with Libsim. I think we'd need a static version or a shared version, depending on which VisIt is getting built.

We probably need to install VTK, Mesa, IceT .a's for static builds so the LIBSIMConfig.cmake file can reference files that are all in the VisIt installation.

Engineering users have variables with multiple integration points. The way to think about these is that they are multi-valued variables. For example, if you have a pressure variable over all zones of a mesh, its like having, in each zone a slew of different values for pressure. Each value is computed at a slightly different position within the zone but nonetheless interpreted as the zonal value. Another way to think about these in VisIt parlance may be as array variables. Though, as I understand Chad, only one among the numerous possible values is ever used at any one time and that is different from a VisIt array variable which is kind of a VisIt vector variable on steriods.
There are two groups of integration points; all those actually computed by the application and those actually written to the Mili database for visualization. We call these all integration points and available integration points.
Typically, Engineering users only ever look at one of the available integration points at a time. Each integration point is like a normal VisIt variable. Its like a mutually exclusive set of variables only one of which can ever be displayed. Do Engineering users ever want to see multiple different integration points in the same plot (e.g. maybe several curve plots derived from different integration points)? The answer would effect whether subset controls (proposed below) is a suitable approach.
We could treat each integration point as a sub-menu variable. So, if pressure has 5 integration points labeled 1,3,4,8,17, the plugin's PopMD method would define ""pressure/ips/1"", ""pressure/ips/3"", ""pressure/ips/4"", ""pressure/ips/8"", ""pressure/ips/17"". That is certainly the easiest way to think about them. However, with large numbers of integration points, this approach quickly becomes unwieldy. And, in any event, we still loose track of representing for the user the notion of all integration points.
It would be better to add support for this via avtArrayMetaData variables and subset controls similarly to how species are handled. A potential space performance issue with using an avtArrayMetaData variable is that VisIt will have to request that the plugin always read all array variable components (e.g. integration points) even if the user is only every looking at one among them. We can consider optimizing this space performance issue away later though.
In any event, in the subset controls window, we can present a list of all array variable components (e.g. integration points) with those not available gray'd out. The user could mutually exclusive select from among the avaialble (not gray'd out) integration points and that would effect which integration point is manipulated/displayed in the plots. In this way, integration points would behave kinda sorta like species variables, which we already handle via the subset controls window. The key distinction being that like species, integration point subsetting is really subsetting the value space (or range) of the field and not its domain whereas other subsetting functionality is subsetting the domain of a field.
Its not too hard to envision cases where users might want do something like see the average of several of the available integration points. If the integration points have some reference (u,v,w) position(s) within a zone, I could envision the user wanting to specify a uvw-box and then averaging or iterating over the available integration points in that box. But, this would be an advanced feature beyond what Engineering is currently requesting.


The required enhancements are somewhat involved...
	
Enhance avtArrayMetadata to specify a map of the available components (e.g. in this case integration points)
	
In use, the plugin would define the total number of components (e.g. integration points) (say something like 50 or 100 for number of components) and then also, optionally, specify a vector of ints of those actually available (say 1,3,4,8,17).


Enhance avtArrayMetadata to specify a bool that array components should be treated mutually exclusively (e.g. only one should ever be used at a time).
	
It is concievable that a GetVector call down to the plugin (which is used for Array variables as well as Vector varaibles) could then be enhanced for this mutually exclusive case to also specify which single component to read. This would address the space performance issue mentioned in the paragraphs above. But, this is an optimization we can defer to later if it is not easily implementable.


Enhance avtGenericDatabase::GetOuput to do something like ArrayMemberSelect (similar to SpeciesSelect or EnumScalarSelect) which does the work of selecting one, mutually exclusive array component, among many available (and to choose closest if selected is not actually available).
Enhance avtSILRestriction and avtSILRestrictionTraverser to handle array member selection similarly to species selection
	
In particular, handle the mutual exclusivity of the member selection


Enhance GUI for subset controls may need modest enhancement as well, probably to display the list of array members (allowing some to be grey'd out for those that are not available).
If there are cases where multiple integration points need to be in the same plot, we could relax the mutual exclusivity constraint, or the user can use VisIt's expression system to define an expression involving multiple of them.

In fact, now that I think about this, maybe instead of doing any of the above, the plugin just loads up such variables as Array variables (avtArrayMetaData during PopulateDatabaseMetadata) and the user just uses the [[array_decompose | http://visit-sphinx-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quantitative/Expressions.html#array-expressions]] expression to pick a given component (integration point).

This is urgent for LLNL Engineering customers.
The idea is a parallel tool that opens a slew of silo files teasing info for a handful of mesh nodes and/or zones out of the files and producing either csv text files or maybe Silo files with DBcurve objects indicating the mesh entities variation over the whole time history.


Needed controls are
	
open first timestep and search global ids for the specified entities
specify which mesh variables to capture (or all)
taking every nth point
dealing with time series where mesh entities specified by a global id come and go 
must run in parallel, so it can divide the work among many processors
make it a function in the Silo library (take care regarding parallel interface)
output format (csv or silo curves)

Note that doing similar for a specific geometric location probably requires interpolation of mesh variables to that specific location. It is not clear such is needed in the initial implementation here.
Finally, what about doing same for an entire lineout (which again would require interpolation) and/or do we need to interpolate through time as well?

From Chris's email:
Hello,
I just joined this mailing list to post a VisIt bug I discovered the other day and it's fix. I would suggest creating a better medium for reporting bugs, as joining this mailing list (with two? administrative authorizations required) is quite cumbersome for someone who is not as much interested in developing VisIt, as just trying to be a good citizen. Yet this is all there is in the FAQs, and there is no guidance on the webpage in general about where to send bug reports.
On to the issue.
Operating System: This bug only effects Windows machines, and I've only tested it on Windows 10 using Windows Power Shell.
Version: VisIt 2.10.20, Python 2.7
Issue: VisIt fails to launch in the system's Python when any arguments are passed to visit.exe.
Steps to reproduce:Run in python the following lines:import syssys.path.append(<path-to-VisIt-site-packages>)import visitvisit.AddArgument(<any-argument-you-like>)visit.Launch()  # this will fail
this also fails, since it essentially just adds the '-nowin' option:import syssys.path.append(<path-to-VisIt-site-packages>)import visitvisit.LaunchNowin() # this will fail
Reason: __read_visit_env in frontend.py in lib/site-packages/visit is not correctly parsing command line arguments on Windows. This may date back to Brad Whitlock's fix in 2013 (according to the comments at the top of the module)? The issue seems to be that Windows reads [""visit.exe -my -args -here"",""-env""] as a program called ""visit.exe -my -args -here"" which takes in one argument, ""-env"". Then it dies because it cannot find a program called ""visit.exe -my -args -here"".
Fix:Since the string with ""visit.exe"" and the arguments other than ""-env"" comes from __visit_cmd and works fine on Unix, the best thing is probably just to parse that string at the moment we are tacking on ""-env"" and creating a list, creating instead a list where ""visit.exe"" and each argument are separate items.
Change line 250, which currently reads ""pcmd = [vcmd, ""-env""]"" to the following:pcmd = vcmd.strip().split(' ') # please note there is a space between the quotations!pcmd.append(""-env"")
I've tested this fix on my machine, and the issue seems to be resolved. I haven't been able to test it in earlier versions of Python or Windows, but the Python docs for the Popen constructor (2.6 is the earliest docs I can find) seem to suggest an argument format like the one I use to resolve the issue, so I would expect that this change would only increase stability and not affect other environments.
Thanks!Christopher Strickland

From Josef Nilsen on the visit-users list:----------------------------------
Trying to get in-situ visualization working on OS X 10.11 using OpenMPI. I have succeeded in the past, but now I'm failing for some reason.
I'm running ""build_visit --parallel"", after which I add the two missing lines in the site config as per my old ticket: http://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1958
Next I run ""recmake_visit.sh"", ""make"" and ""make install"" (I have also tried setting it up manually with ""make package"", but it made no difference).
The mandelbrot example works, and running my simulation on a single process also works. As I run more than one process, the simulation crashes as soon as it reaches the point in the main loop where it detects that VisIt has connected:
Caught signal number 10 BUS: Bus Error, possibly illegal memory access...User provided function() line 0 in unknown directory unknown file
This exact piece of code has worked in the past. VisIt is already in the path and I am passing -dir, which kind of reminded me of this old email conversation (the fix did not work either): https://elist.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-developers/2014-September/014195.html
Does anyone have a clue as to what I'm doing wrong? Has there been any breaking changes in libsim (for example the new batch feature) requiring me to update my code? For example this stub I used to keep just so that the simulation wouldn't crash: http://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1928

Hi Cyrus,
One more request for the next VisIt release :)
I might have mentioned this previously, but we rely on short URL links as the main way to track MFEM downloads. This is important for us during project reviews and when writing funding proposals.
Do you mind changing
svn_bin/bv_support/bv_mfem.sh
to use our short URLs instead of directly grabbing the files from mfem.github.io/releases? This is whats done for example in spack and homebrew/science:
https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/mfem/package.pyhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pull/3530/commits/2a2549783607af45641c8c82540b26f383e3970a
Ill be happy to send you the list of the short URLs for the different MFEM versions, or you can grab them directly from http://mfem.org/download.
Please let me know if we can be of any assistance with this. Thank you in advance for your help!
Tzanio

Cyrus' Note: I tried this before and there was some road block in build_visit, we should look into it again and find the issue.

As I work on updating our rendering code for VTK-7, I wonder if using vtk charts in VisIt would help us create better presentation graphics (???)


VTK has quite a few xy-type plots: 
	
Line (our standard curve plot)
Scatter (curve plot with glyphed points instead of lines)
Stacked (space-filled curves stacked on top of each other)
Bar (like our histogram plot)There is even a parallel coordinates plot.

Some notes on differences from our normal rendering pipeline:
Data for charts is stored in a vtkTable (instead of a vtkDataSet).A vtkContextView is added to a vtkRenderer, and the chart instance is added to the vtkContextView. (Instead of vtkMapper/vtkActor pairs).

Its probably not fair to list this as a bug. But, it occurs to me that global node/zone ids at scale will almost always need to be 64 bit (e.g. the mesh sizes will be more than 2 billion nodes or zones).
I think we currently use type 'int' in many places internally for this.
Going across the board to 64 bit is probably simplest, lest complex. But, it does mean a 2x memory hit which is sometimes unnecessary for smaller problems.

When VisIt first starts (by double clicking) main GUI panel is normal width and fine.After restoring a session file, main GUI panel gets widened by 2-3x its normal width and cannot be dragged/shrunk back down. Its like the minimum width of the window has been made unnecessarily large. Removing the .session.gui file has no effect on this behavior.Going to Appearance and changing to Windows style triggers enough of the GUI widget resizing logic that the min width gets reset to something sane and the main panel behaves normally again.Saving the session now fixes the session file from causing the problem again when the session is reloaded.
The key problem is that once the user leaves work for the day and is working directly on the laptop display, the main gui panel can be stuck in unnecessarily wide state that cannot be fixed and takes 80% of the laptop screen realestate.

I'm using visit 2.8.0 on a machine running ubuntu. I am just plotting the mesh and using the displace operator to show the movement of the body (the system solves for the movement in the x and y directions so my displace vector is {x,y,0}). It seems that I can visualize the mesh without the displace operator being used for second order elements. The trouble arises when I use the displace operator. I can use a pseudocolor plot to visualize each component of the bodies movement, but this isn't exactly what I want.
When I try to use elements like ""TRI6"", ""QUAD8"" or ""QUAD9"" (if you're familiar with Libmesh) I get the following warning from VisIt:
""The data set has a quadratic element in it and this code to convert 2D elements to polydata is only capable of 1:1 cell to cell translation, whereas quadratic cells produce a 1:N translation.""
I guess I am wondering why code to perform a displacement is even sensitive to element type. Doesn't a displacement work just by displacing the control points of whatever element type it encounters? The error message above is coming from avtCommonDataFunctions to convert an unstructured grid to poly data.

The QSpinBox signal we generally observe  is 'valueChanged'.  This signal is emitted with every click of the up/down arrows,  and for every digit typed starting at the # of signficant digits set with minimum.  Eg if minimum is 100, then 'valueChanged' will be emitted as soon as the 3rd digit is typed, and then for every digit typed thereafter.
When we observe this signal and update a plot or operator's attributes, then we are going through the atts->Notify/UpdateWindow process more frequently than we should.
I suggest one simple change:Turn off keyboard tracking for all QSpinBox instances (myspinbox->setKeyboardTracking(false)).  For typed input, this means the 'valueChanged' signal would not be emitted until return is pressed or the spinbox loses focus.
This helps for the case of typing input into a QSpinBox.  It doesn't help with the up/down arrows, and I'm not sure if this aspect should be addressed as well.

Separation of fullhelp text into resources/help/usage seems like the right thing to do architecturally but now having separated internallauncher so completely from its usage output means few if any developers even realize there is usage text that may need to be updated. I guess a hook warning might be in order such that if changes are made to one or the other of internallauncher or fullhelp, a committer is warned that the other may need to be updated. But, that seems like a like of work too.

hey kevin and cyrus,
so I mentioned this before, but its getting to be a limitation on the work were trying to do. if we try to sample SPH data to a grid larger than ~200^3, the compute engine goes OOM. this seems to be a problem of allocating the entire lattice on all available processors, and since the processors share a single memory bank (for instance if you run 20 procs on rzalastor), this quickly grows out of bounds of available memory. I know kevin was at one point working on streamlining the operator to use less memory, but have you guys looked yet into completely redesigning the way the grid is handled in parallel? at the moment, just the particle data is partitioned, mapped to a local grid of the size of the entire domain, and then at the end, all local grids are summed together for the global grid.

I had some success using commands from your script and googling ffmpeg options, thanks again for sending. Posting what I found here in case it would be helpful to others.
To remove compression artifacts which are present in video (but not in stills) set -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 This makes frames indistinguishable to my eye from the still frames. Setting ""-crf 18"" determines the compression level, turn down towards 1 for less compression and larger files. Turn up and compression becomes obvious. The option ""veryslow"" instructs it that time to encode the movie is not important; there are faster algorithms which the internet says are for live telecasts that need to render instantly.
So far, the best I have found is to output jpeg format at very high resolution (4x HD, fixed 7680 width) then scale down by 4 to HD resolution (1920 width). This looks more crisp than outputting jpeg files at 1920. To tell ffmpeg the scale add -vf scale=iw*.25:ih*.25
The final line is thenffmpeg -framerate 30 -i frames%4d.jpeg -vf scale=iw*.25:ih*.25 -r 30 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 frames.mp4
This seems to handle changes in input frame rate well; 30 or 60 fps in output also works well.
Best, Alex

If you generate a plot from a remote machine in the same Window as a plot from the local machine, the result on screen may look fine but VisIt crashes almost instantly if you try to save the image with ""Save Window"".
There are no obvious clues in the -debug logs perhaps because it fails so quickly (SocketLostConnectionException).
Use-case: Comparing an experimental image on a local machine with the results of a simulation on a supercomputer.
If both datasets are on the same machine it will work.A Save Window using the Screen-Capture option will also generally work.
Further debugging hints at the problem being caused by a NULL ZBuffer.(/null pointer dereference)
avtWholeImageCompositeWithZ::Execute  calling  GetZBuffer()
One of the images (presumably the remote one) has a NULL ZBuffer.
Further investigation suggests that the problem is related to a couple of previously reported bugs:
VisIt Bug #180""SR mode with local geometry crashes after save window"" 
andVisIt Bug #639
See these for further details.

Also when the build_visit script defaults to searching in the VisIt website for the third-party libraries, there are 2 issues:- Xerces-C is missing, as pointed out in my previous mail. You can find it here: http://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.1.2.tar.gz- XSD is missing, you can find it here: http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/xsd/4.0/xsd-4.0.0+dep.tar.bz2- The archive damaris-1.0.1.tgz is incorrect, it contains damaris-1.0. So it should be replaced with https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/35204/damaris-1.0.1.tgz
I don't know if you have a policy behind hosting some third-party dependencies and not other, I see that boost is also no here. Here the problem is mainly with XercesC, which has changed location since the build_visit script was made. Hopefully it doesn't change anymore.
Thanks a lot!

GetSILSetID() is called in a O(# domains) loop, it calls FindSet, which does a binary search on a data structure that is O(# of domains)

Suggested by Peter Lindstrom:
---Guys,
I have a VisIt question/suggestion.  I have a 3D scalar field that ranges from -5 to 5.  When tinkering with the contour plot, I wanted to switch from linear to log-spaced contours, which doesn't work due to the negative values:
Contour:  ()viewer: You have non-positive data values, so a log plot won't work.  You must use the limits option to restrict the data limits to values greater than 0.
I imagine there might be other VisIt features that depend on a log scale that break when faced with non-positive data.  Usually when I run across such data sets, I use instead of log(x)
arcsinh(x / 2) = log((x + sqrt(4 + x^2)) / 2)
which asymptotically and rather quickly approaches log(x) for large x.  This also does the ""right thing"" for negative values by compressing the range symmetrically to how positive values are handled, i.e. arcsinh(x / 2) = arcsinh(-x / 2).  Maybe this would be a useful feature in VisIt?- Peter Lindstrom
----Hi Peter,
Thats a clever way to attack the problem.  I think now, users could define this with our expression language.
Better yet, if there was a way to name this expression we could create an easy way to either define the expression or add a named plotting option.
Any idea of what to call it?

MOAB is the first plugin in Visit that uses a parallel TPL to read data in parallel from a single, shared file. It needs parallel HDF5 to do so. So far, build_visit builds only serial HDF5.
Likewise, VisIt knows about parallel and serial database engine targets. But, it doesn't know about parallel and serial TPL dependencies (at least I don't think it does).
A lot of other things can depend on HDF5 (netcdf, H5Part, Xdmf, etc., + many VisIt plugins). Can we get by with a single libhdf5.so installation that supports both serial and parallel (certainly, the HDF5 library is capable of that) or do we have to build two separate HDF5 installations, one with and the other without MPI dependence? Same question for libMOAB.
Or, do we need to build serial and parallel HDF5 installations and serial and parallel MOAB installations to handle this.

A user had a bunch of databases all named Vec.vtu. Each was in a different directory; dirA/Vec.vtu, dirB/Vec.vtu, dirC

changing the d2 expression to be 'd*cell_constant(mesh1, 100.0)' or even 'd*node_constant(mesh1, 100.0)', then the Scatter plot will work.
Now, swap the x and y coordinates for the Scatter plot: make X use the original d2 expression (d*100.), and make Y use 'u'.Scatter plot works.
So the failure when using the expression depends on whether or not it is considered the 'primary' variable in the pipeline.

It is not possible to get parallel hardware acceleration with existing X servers.
The bug is in the file engine/main/XDisplay.C in function XDisplay::Initialize:[...]    //updated: enabling new logic    if(!this->launch || (this->xserver = xinit(this->display, user_args))  1)    //if(this>launch && (this->xserver = xinit(this->display, user_args))  -1)

The ""new logic"" causes the function to fail if no X server should be launched or if the X server fails to launch. The ""old logic"" caused the function to fail if a X server should be launched and it fails.
So this function always fails when existing X servers should be used. This causes that no attempt is made to connect to the display server, see function Engine::SetupDisplay in engine/main/Engine.C. As a result, the parallel engine fails or falls back to software rendering.
My tests with the ""old logic"" were successful, so I propose to simply revoke the ""new logic"".

Maybe Dan Laney or Cyrus Harrison would know.2. Some of the nodes say they can't be displayed because of a 2D/3D plot incompatibility.

I see we can build our own version of zlib with build_visit. I saw that some other packages in build_visit make use of this if it is specified on the command line, which is good. I also found a dependence on zlib handled with a version from VTK (Xdmf). Similar things are happening with XML2. I found the Xdmf references XML2 from VTK. Uintah also depends on XML2, but doesn't try to use the VTK version and will cause the buildof Uintah to fail.
We should probably use a single version of zlib everywhere and have its use determined by a flag to build_visit, so that it doesn't happen by default. The same applies to XML2, it should be controllable on the command line and used if specified on the command line.

We already have logic that detects OOM in engine and will write to each rank's debug logs if -debug level is at least 1.
It would be better to let a user know when*ever* this happens.
What about having MPI ranks pwrite() a short message to a new log file in a new dir ~/.visit/.critical_engine_messages directory
pwrite is a 'parallel atomic write' which I use in MACSio for a similar brand of high priority messaging.
Upon starting a visit session, we can create a pid-labeled dir and an empty file nprocsX32 chars of white-space. Then, if any processor pwrites a critical message there, the viewer could slurp it up an display it.
Maybe with each engine launch, the engine creates the critical messages log (somewhere) and informs the viewer where to look for it.
The viewer would simply have to occasionally stat the file for last modification time an then read it for any messages.

A user had a new version of the CarpetHDF5 library.
So, he built a new version of the CarpetHDF5 plugin with it.
His new version got built and installed in ~/.visit/...
He even changed the version number in his custom plugin to be different than the one in VisIt.
When he displayed them in plugin manager, he sees only the Name of the plugin and he winds up seeing both with same name there.
He wanted to disable the built-in one that came with VisIt. But, which one is that?
It might make sense to display either the path to the plugin or the version number of the plugin in the plugin manager window. However, the version number will be different only if the user took action to change the plugin's version number. So, I don't think version number is reliable way to distinguish. Using the path is potentially problematic because the path could be a long, long string. We could opt for a simple tag 'builtin'/'custom' to distinguish them too.

Hello,
I built Visit 2.11 on our Cray XC the other day. I am also compilingPython in the process. I had to change the Python configuration for itto work, or I would get

undefined symbol: _PyUnicodeUCS2_AsDefaultEncodedString

errors when compiling Visit. The trick was to add

--enable-unicode=ucs4

to line 16062 of build_visit2_11_0 in build_python.
I don't know how widely necessary that trick is but I thought I'd reportit nevertheless. I can provide more details if needed.

Rick Angelini ran into several issues. In summary...

For some reason, Xdmf builds its library(s) in a 'bin' dir instead of a 'lib' dir. Its probably cosmetic but lets check that out
bv_xdmf doesn't set LIBXML2_LIBRARY variable name quite right. Its missing the :FILEPATH qualifier. That may create problems when Xdmf build tries to find the libxml2 library in our VTK insallation
XDMF_SYSTEM_LIBXML2 setting? What should it be. I think it should be set to OFF and we should be using libxml2 in VTK, as the other variables we define appear to be trying to do that. However, examining Xdmf's CMakeList.txt file suggests that SYSTEM may have a different interpretation there.
XDMF_SYSTEM_LIBZ should be adjusted to either be YES or to be NO and instead use whatever ZLIB build_visit has installed (and definitely not vtk's zlib as per #2679)

I don't honestly know if anyone has ever had to use this option but I don't think so.
It was added when we added logic to engine to implement our own, non-spin-wait broadcast for idling engines waiting for input. The fear at the time was that maybe that logic might fail or cause issues and we'd need to either a) fall-back to normal MPI_Bcase behavior (e.g. spin-wait) or b) adjust nano-sleep thresholds.
It isn't necessarily bad to keep in there and removing it only prevents some flexibility. So, maybe we just need to remove it from --fullhelp output.

There is a request for enhancements to the reflection operator to better support GrizIt. The are two distinct but related features:1) Reflect about an arbitrary plane defined by a point and a normal vector. This is currently possible to accomplish using a user created matrix and the transform operator, however, this requires additional plots for every reflection.2) Two modes for reflection"" cumulative and non-cumulative. Cumulative is the way VisIt currently does reflections. Non-cumulative would only reflect the original mesh. I attached an image that visually demonstrates the disctinction.

Here is the e-mail from Matthieu Dorier:
Hi,
I haven't found a way to do that in the version of VisIt that I have (2.10.3):by default the range of a color scale in a colormap will automatically adapt to the range of values in the data. Alternatively we can set the minimum and/or the maximum for this scale. For some color scales that have a symmetry (e.g., red - white - blue) it would be useful to fix the center of the scale to a given value (e.g., 0) but let the lower/upper bounds vary depending on the data.
Thanks,

Folks --
I just updated to VisIt 2.11.0 on OS X 10.12.1. When trying to open an ExodusII file, I get the spinning beach ball and wind up needing to do a force quit. I've tried a few different files, generated both by CUBIT and exported from libMesh. I've verified that I can open the same files using VisIt 2.10.3. I also can open other types of files (e.g. from SAMRAI) in VisIt 2.11.0. I'm currently using the OS X executable from the LLNL site. I'm going to try building VisIt from source to see if that helps.

I was able to successfully open both files on kickit using the public 2.11.0 installed there. The hex20 file displayed properly but the hex27 file had all the hexes looking funky. I assume we are having a node numbering issue with the hex27 elements.

With the ability to draw curves as tubes and ribbons as well as end points via Pseudocolor plot curves must be ""clean"" (free of duplicate points). vtkCleanPolydata cleans in such a way that it removes duplicate points based on position only which can skew the results. Think about a critical point where the velocity is near zero. There is still advancement in time but little spatial displacement. vtkCleanPolydata would just remove the duplicate point but the time values are actually quite different. Thus it would appear that the advection stopped when it did not as the last points would be removed.
Within the integral curve operator I implemented some smart cleaning so tubes and ribbons could be drawn correctly without skewing the result. Similar smart cleaning needs to be implemented in the Pseudocolor plot. Note: the smart cleaning in the integral curve operator is based on the velocity.

This is a bad bug.
By default, Silo prevents object overwrites.
However, you can disable this by calling DBSetOverwrite() with a non-zero arg.
On PDB driver, this means object data is just re-written.
However, on HDF5 driver, instead of re-writting these objects, new datasets are written and the old ones orphaned.
If there is a bug in a data producer, this can lead to unusually large files with no explanation as to cause.

I have a two level data set. Here are the result of min/max from the query.
Original Data:sigmaT4/0 -- Min = 0 (zone 0 in patch level0, patch0 at coord <7.2352, -0.274519, -0.259955>)sigmaT4/0 -- Max = 156318 (zone 1523 in patch level1, patch2553 at coord <28.0883, 14.4809, 2.79451>)
Current Plot L0 onlysigmaT4/0 -- Min = 0 (zone 0 in patch level0, patch0 at coord <7.2352, -0.274519, -0.259955>)sigmaT4/0 -- Max = 37428 (zone 196 in patch level0, patch0 at coord <7.7648, 0.274519, 0.259955>)
Current Plot L1 onlysigmaT4/0 -- Min = 233.22 (zone 624 in patch level1, patch1981 at coord <23.4543, -0.0686296, 2.14462>)sigmaT4/0  Max = 156318 (zone 1523 in patch level1, patch2553 at coord <28.0883, 14.4809, 2.79451>)
Plot 1 contains both L0/L1 and uses the original data the color range is as I would expect: 0-156318(not shown) Plot 1a contains both L0/L1 and uses the current data the color range MAX is NOT as I would expect: 156318 (22160 wrong)
Plot 2 contains L0 and uses the current data the color range MAX is NOT as I would expect: 37428 (22160 wrong)Plot 3 contains L1 and uses the current data the color range MAX is NOT as I would expect: 156318 (22160 wrong)
The legend MIN for both plot 1a, 2 and 3 are CORRECT 0, 0, and 233.22 respectively.
FWIW I have verified via a simple PS plot of rendering a single field sans any operators and swapping between original and current plot changes the legend. It should not.
I also saw some other issues when restoring a session. Here the Min/Max in the legend were wrong. I also a similar issue when I did a replace operation. I was not able to even figure out the origin of those values.

George Zagaris had a topologically 2d vtk dataset and wanted to revolve it.
Because of how it was written to vtk it ends up being recognized by visit as 3d. He applied a project operator and then tried to apply a revolve operator. The revolve operator complained that it wasn't 2d, but VisIt was clearly in a 2d rendering mode.
After exporting the result of the project operator back out to vtk, he was able to open up the newly exported data and apply a revolve operator.

I dunno if this is the result of choices VisIt has made or VTK but depth cueing is using color-modulation rather than opacity modulation.
This means it can only work for constant color background. It does not work for gradient or image backgrounds.
If it is possible/simple to adjust code to use opacity modulation then I think this could be a quick fix.

but the error message printed to the screen is:ERROR: Couldn't find file /home/biagas2/Branches/trunk/src/plots/Mesh/
I can create a new file, edit settings and save, and then reopen that new file.

This recently started happening on the trunk with line datasets with nodal data.
1. Open attached dataset.2. Make a Pseudocolor plot of airVf.3. Change color table to hot_desaturated and make the line width 8.4. Draw the plot.
The line will use colors that are interpolated through color space instead of using 1D textures to make a better picture.
I find that when I disable the avtPolylineCleanupFilter in the Pseudocolor plot that the textures are used again and the plot looks nice. Something about the polyline cleanup filter is breaking texturing.

BoxLib and Chombo map into a common data structure set one level deeper, after the file reading.
The mapping-per-amr block is specialized to work Gunther did, but I think it should be moved to this deeper uber plugin level.   It has some hack aspects to it, and there are several optimizations that Gunther and I have discussed but nobody has time to work on :-(
Milo's COGENT project uses this capability heavily for tokomak edge plasma modeling, which is now part of ATOM.  The Hans Johansen's AMR Atmosphere project in ACME make use of this code in VisIt all the time.      Are there development resources at reaction-eng.com that can help?  Like all vis capabilities, it is a matter of scraping together little 5% efforts from a broad user base to get anything done.  We need to cast a net and find people/money to make this happen somehow.

Hi Brian,
I suspect the ""core"" of VisIt is not a suitable target for these data structures as it may require re-working a lot of VisIt internals (which are based on VTK).
But, it might make sense to utilize more of the AMR data structures in perhaps a new generealized-AMR VisIt uber-plugin, of which things like Chombo, Boxlib, SAMRAI, etc. could be different ""flavors"".
Thats a non-trivial under-taking but might make some sense, especially if there is manpower available to support it.

Ultimately, an attempt to write data to a silo file that is NOT opened with DB_APPEND will fail.
However, it will fail with useless low-level error messages instead of simply indicating that an attempt to write on a read-only file.
Unfortunately, its tedious to fix. The public file handle needs to have a new flag added for whether the file is open for writing and then every high-level API method needs to have logic added to perform this check.

I ran into and detangled this why trying to install a beta version of the Blueprint plugin on the RZ at LLNL:
The version of cmake we are using (3.0.2) provides a FindHDF5 with clunky logic that will fall back to always use h5cc if it's in your path.
bv_hdf5 was recently changed on the trunk to not install h5cc, so our build_visit hdf5 wasn't providing h5cc.
h5cc is in the default path on several platforms,  (including LLNL's LC platforms) so tpls using CMake's FindHDF5 support will always find the wrong hdf5 libs.
changing bv_hdf5 back to install everything fixes the problem  -- the cmake logic finds h5cc for our install and uses it.

When CMake'ing VisIt fails in some fundamental way, the error often scrolls off the screen and processing continues such that user is unaware of issue.
I propose adding a strict mode...
I wonder...is there a way to invoke CMake to die on first warning? I looked briefly and didn't find support for this in CMake itself. If not, maybe a way to globally set MESSAGE command's message type?
One issue I see in top-level CMakeLists.txt is that we use MESSAGE a*lot with type of STATUS even when issuing failure (e.g. NOT FOUND) messages.
But, I think we could maybe do this...         Leave all FATAL_ERROR messages unchanged         For all STATUS messages indicating an ignorable failure (e.g. NOT FOUND) change those to use GLOBAL_ERROR_MODE         For all WARNING messages, changes those to use GLOBAL_ERROR_MODE         For all AUTHOR_WARNING messages (don't think we have any of these) changes those to use GLOBAL_ERROR_MODE         For all SEND_ERROR messages, changed those to GLOBAL_ERROR_MODE
By default, set GLOBAL_ERROR_MODE to WARNINGBut, if -DWERROR:BOOL=ON, that will set GLOBAL_ERROR_MODE to FATAL_ERROR
In theory, then, running CMake with -DWERROR:BOOL=ON would have the effect of terminating immediately upon first less-than-ideal result.

But, that warning seems to trigger an erroneous error message...
The plot spatial dimensions do not match, 2D vs 3D. Plots need to be in windows with plots of the same spatial dimension.
as well.
I suspect the logic is there checking plot dimensions and it assumes the empty plot is a dimension other than what is already in the window. So, dimensions mismatch.
We need to either spoof the empty plot's dimension to artificially match what is there, or we need to adjust dimension matching logic to ignore empty plots.
This case can come up in empty relaxer nodes problems more often than we'd like.

You can imagine a time series where the size of an object like a point mesh grows and shrinks over time, maybe with some states having no points, and in those states, the object will not exist in the metadata, causing any plots or expressions involving it (that work fine at other timesteps) to fail.

2755,Developer Review,Bug,Normal, Potential issue with Exodus plugin in obtaining element block count ,-,-,-,Mark Miller,02/07/2017,,0%,,02/07/2017 08:59 pm,02/14/2017 06:36 pm,3 - Occasional,2 - Minor Irritation,2.12.0,,,All,Any,"
So, I've seen this in some data Rick Angelini gave me.
Its 32-way Exodus data. Some files define 3 element blocks, some 4 and some 5.
I've opened this data in serial VisIt, the first file it examines has 3 element blocks and so it decides there are only 3 element blocks during populate database metadata. The additional blocks in those files that have 'em are ignored. Thats BAD. Simply changing which file VisIt thinks is the first file to open so that it opens a file with 5 element blocks fixes this.
In parallel, I seriously have no idea how VisIt can get it right because there appears to be no communication regarding the element block count. Thats bad.
OTOH, we don't want VisIt opening all files in an ensemble just to obtain element block count.


What is the solution?
	
Require that all Exodus data producers always indicate global element block count in each file. For non-existent blocks, the exodus file will have to have a zero element block for those blocks. That basically fixes the problem by enforcing data producer to produce uniform exodus data. 
Provide database open option to specify the element block count manually?
Provide !NBLOCKS-like directive, !NELEM_BLOCKS that indicates the block count
Just require that any .visit/.exodus file have the file with greatest element block count at the head of the list
Open all the files and find the global element block count. In parallel this may not be as bad as it sounds.

Note that this is identically the same problem we have with Mili and for which we had the unsatisfactory solution of a makemili tool. The long term solution we are hoping to get LLNL Engineering customers to use there is for data producer to do effectively the work makemili would have done but at mc_close (Mili close) time. By adding logic to Mili's database close method and requiring data producer call it collectively on all processors, we can do work in Mili library to gather up information from individual ranks and then write the unified information to the mili database.
It might be worth thinking about a generalized strategy for this for products like Mili, Exodus, netCDF, VTK, Silo, that would be available to codes to just sort of use out the box.

Curve objects in VisIt are represented as a 1D rectilinear mesh.
This is so we can support operators on Curves.
However, LLNL/Engineering/GrizIt users will need to be able to construct curve objects that are a sequence of points joined by lines (think of a 2D circle for example).
One way to handle such curves in current VisIt infrastructure is to use 2, 1D rectilinear mesh objects, one for the X and one for the Y both as a function of a parametric variable, u, which ranges from 0...npts-1. I believe all of VisIt's operators could be posed upon such a new style of curve object and might even offer some interesting flexibility not previously possible on operating upon curves.
We should explore this.

We do not appear to have an easy way to plot the individual scalar (or combinations of scalar members into a vector) components of an array variable with our standard plots.
I mean, if we open a database with an 'array' variable, we have one plot that apparently by default attempts to plot all the components. That is the label plot. For label plot, I don't see an easy way to turn off certain arrays or only see certain arrays. For other plots, we have the reverse situation. We don't have an easy way to display certain members. In fact, the aggregate Array variable object doesn't even appear in most of the plot menus.
Now, the work-around for this is for the user to define expressions that construct variables from the components of the array variable. But, that is inconvenient and inefficient.
I am wondering if it makes sense to add to the subset controls window the ability to enable/disable certain members of an array variable. In many ways, this is similar to 'species' selection which is already handled via the subset controls window. There is the question of what happens as we vary the 'output' of the selection say between a single member (e.g. a scalar mesh variable) and say 3 members (a vector mesh variable). But, I think having this kind of control (in a common place and not per-plot) would be hugely more convenient.
The case I am working with is climate data over a 2D elevation grid where climate values (temp, velocity) are known at numerous (>40) different elevation levels about the terrain. It isn't natural to think of that is a 3D block of data is it?

Here is the response from Jim Schaff about an inquiry on the status of the VCell reader.
We wrote this plugin years ago in an attempt to integrate data from one of our solvers with VisIt.  Since then we have significantly expanded our suite of solvers (and added new data formats), and have standardized on another approach to VisIt interoperability.  We instead translate all of our data to VTK unstructured grids before sending data to VisIt.
We no longer use or maintain the VCellMTMD plugin.  Sorry, I should have informed you earlier so you don't waste time maintaining VCellMTMD.
We have also embraced the VisIt/pyside integration and deploy our VisIt capability as a QT application launched from VCell.  This capability is currently pre-release quality, but we plan to bring it to production soon.  As you likely know, Kathleen resolved our inquiry about pyside support in Windows by including a fix in VisIt 2.12.1.  This worked for our VisIt/pyside application in WIndows 7 but still crashes under Windows 10.  I had promised Kathleen that I would create a simplified python script which would either illustrate the problem in VisIt (or reveal our own mistakes).

It May come a bit late, but how about using interval notation, i.e., something like [0,15],18,[20,34]? Not sure if that makes parsing more difficult, but it would make it possible to specify both open and closed intervals, e.g. [0,15),18,(20, 43] if you don't want to include the 15 and 20 into the ranges.

This came up as result of user issue where a CLI script defining a number of expressions has required more and more use of recenter operator as new releases of VisIt have come out.
I think VisIt tries to be smart when dealing with mixed centering variables in an expression. That said, are we being sane?
Might it make sense to do all expressions in nodal? I know that numerically the results would differ a bit for an all-zonal expression but this would simplify things for users quite a bit.

It doesn't matter what the two time args to the two GetMetaData() calls are. A call to GetMetaData() after OpenDatabase() will cause the active time slider to change, somehow. Note, that it's name does not change. Its just that after the GetMetaDAta(), VisIt thinks there is only one time state in the active time slider. Only work-around is to reopen the database after a call to GetMetaData().

A user reported that when he increased the number of tabs from 8 to 15, the number of tabs displayed did not increase. I verified that this is indeed the case. I noticed that hitting apply and resizing the window larger caused the additional tabs to appear. Here is the original e-mail from Rishi Ganeriwala (ganeriwala1@llnl.gov). The bug was in 2.12.2, he implied that 2.12.1 doesn't have this bug. I didn't check that.
Hi Eric,
Ive noticed what may be a bug in the latest version of Visit.  When you click on the pick option to get values at specific nodal coordinates, in the window that pops up there is an option to increase the maximum number of tabs (default is 8).  However, when I try to increase this number past 8, the number of tabs visible does not increase.  For example, if I set it to 15, I still only see 8 tabs (see below screenshot).  However, I can select 15 different points before the tabs start being overwritten.  In the previous version of Visit 15 tabs would appear at the top so I could see the values of all my picks.
Is there a way to open an older version of Visit on the LC?  I was looking through /usr/gapps/visit/, but there doesnt seem to be an equivalent frontendlauncher executable for the old versions as is present for the current version.  Please advise.
Thank you,Rishi

Allen reported a bug with exporting a database with the CLI when doing client/server. Below is his e-mail. We should at a minimum investigate if this is new behavior.
Hi,
I just ran into an oddity working with a user when trying to export a database.
0. Start Visit.
1. Open a remote database
2. Open the CLI
3. In the CLI
ExportDBAtts = ExportDBAttributes()ExportDBAtts.allTimes = 0ExportDBAtts.filename = ""dissipation_data"" ExportDBAtts.dirname = """" ExportDBAtts.variables = (""CCUVelocity/0"", ""CCVVelocity/0"", ""CCWVelocity/0"", ""dissipationRate/0"", ""density/0"", )ExportDBAtts.writeUsingGroups = 0ExportDBAtts.groupSize = 48ExportDBAtts.opts.types = (0)ExportDBAtts.opts.help = """" ExportDBAtts.db_type = ""Xmdv"" ExportDBAtts.db_type_fullname = ""Xmdv_1.0"" ExportDatabase(ExportDBAtts)
Error:
Traceback (most recent call last):  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>visit.VisItException: ""Xmdv"" is not a valid plugin type.  Make sure the Metadata Server is running.
Now there is a metadata server running. However, it is on the remote machine only. The CLI is not seeing that.
If I do the exact same export via the GUI (and implicitly the Viewer) that works. Which it should because the Viewer sees the remote metadata server. And as expected the exported data is on the remote machine.
If I open a file locally so to start the metadata server then the CLI sees that metadata server and the export will work (though all on the remote machine). And as expected the exported data is on the remote machine.
So the question is why is the CLI not seeing the remote database? I am not sure if this issue is new or not. I believe it is new based on talking with my user.
Cheers,
Allen

Until today, I hadn't realized that VisIt does indeed have the ability to broadcast a metadata object. This means a single rank in parallel can construct it and then broadcast it to all ranks in parallel. This is hugely convenient for dealing with parallel in most if not all database plugins. But, its a bit hidden from view. In fact, the only plugin that exploits it is Silo. I have been working with MOAB and Mili plugin developers dealing with this issue and we have always stumbled over the issue that its not easy to handle PopMD in parallel whilst being efficient in terms of filesystem interactions but keeping the algorithm simple.
I recommend the following to help ease development of db plugins for parallel...That VisIt automagically broadcast metadata (from rank 0) and only avert that if a plugin requests not to. This would be a new feature on metadata object. Call it the mdBcastRank. If set to -1, then its off. Otherwise, it specifies a rank to use as broadcaster and will do the broadcast just prior to return from call to PopMD in the avtFileFormat methods. We would have to touch many existing plugins to turn it off.
I rate this as high impact because it hugely simplifies db plugin development.

Hi.
To cut down on dead space, I've moved the legend inside the main frameof my 2D Pseudocolor plot (I'm not blocking out any interesting data).
Since no single font color makes the numerical labels of the legendstand out against the changing-color background, I'd like to use abounding box to provide a uniform background.
But the BB I get from Annotation -> Objects -> Legend -> Appearance ->Bounding Box isn't large enough. It's big enough to encompass thewhole pseudocolor color strip, but it cuts off the top and bottomlegend labels.
The problem goes away if I enable ""Draw title"" and ""Draw min/max"", butI don't want either of those in my plot.
Does anyone know how to increase the size of the BB?
thanks,

don't do operator-created expressions
	
currently know pref. for this so need to add one
We could adjust logic in operators to create operator exprs only when mesh or var count is low, say less than 50


don't create subset plot entries for meshes of just one block. Thats pointless and easily corrected.
We populate the menu in the viewer too. Do we really need to do that? An informal survey indicated several developers weren't even aware of the option in the viewer's menu suggesting users are even less aware of this feature. I think it would be easiest/best to remove it entirely. Short of that, maybe it is never created until some user actually does the GUI actions to suggest its needed by right-clicking in the viewer, going to Plots and then trying to add a plot.

The above changes actually make things almost useable for seseame.pdb (an extreme example of a database with a large number of objects)
Next, we need to add smarts to not constantly create and destroy variable menus as frequently as we currently do. We enter VariableMenuPopulator a lot. It has some smarts to return early but I think we need to improve that. I think we should return early when the database and timestep are same since last visit. But, I don't think we do that. Furthermore, some of the logic there to determine early return is expensive (operator== on expression list iterates over all expressions). The order in which we consider each expression's members in an individual expression's operator== could have some impact too. For example, we should try to compare those attributes of expressions that are more likely to be different first. The operator[] on ExpressionList is a linear search. That can be fixed easily too. I've currently coded a simple hashing mechanism there and improved performance quite a bit.
We're also taking too much memory. The GUI process easily reaches 1 Gigabyte on sesame.pdb. Hacks for several of the obove changes demonstrate we can get that back down to something reasonable, maybe 250 Mb. However, I think the right long term answer is to switch to an on-demand form of menu creation where we keep a sort of dom object internally regarding what the full menu structure should look like but only realize the parts of that structure with the Qt widgets that are needed at any moment.
I rated impact as high but expected use as rare because I think it is rare we deal with databases with large numbers of objects.

Mike Puso reported that if he reads in a vtk file containing a surface into VisIt and performs a clip operation he gets an error message and an empty plot. He gave me his data on the closed and it contains polydata. I looked into the source of the error message and basically there is a conversion being done when the topological dimension is less than the spatial dimension and it skips cells that are greater than the topological dimension. It turns out the spatial dimension is 3 and the topological dimension is 0, causing all the cells to be skipped.
Looking at the debug logs I see that it determines the spatial and topological dimension based on the first file of a collection of VTK files grouped using a "".visit"" file. The first file doesn't have any cells and that is why the topological dimension is 0.

I selected files from 2 different directories, I created plots from a file from one directory and then created plots from a file in the second directory. I saved the session, exited, restarted visit and restored the session. The files in the selected files list were from the second directory I had open, (visit probably saved the path of the directory that the select files window had open), and the plots from the first file had the file name in the path, indicating that the file was no longer open.

-------------Hi Everyone,
This adds an example that clearly demonstrates a case where DDF and Data Binning output do not agree, but should.
( This example uses a contrived mass sum on rect3d.silo )
The issue seems to be related to Data Binning not getting the correct extents when coords are used as binning dimensions.
I believe this represents the problems that Jonathan Mackey & Phillp Gast have reported on the users list.
This also demonstrates that the DDF and Data Binning do agree when we explicitly create and use our own input exprs for the coords instead of using the Data Binning options related to the coords.
It is an important reproducer  but the test will fail, so I am adding it to the skip list.
I also fixed a few issues in the testing infrastructure related with logging assert base test cases.

Then use

So, for your file...

I am still trying to figure out why the format string isn't working quite right.

Also, I believe ANSYS file *requires* 3 integer columns for node #, solid #, line # *before* coord values.
Your file has only node #. I think a correctly formatted ANSYS file has white space for the other columns
when those columns are not used. OTOH, why do they have a programmable 'format' string that is
capable of indicating the number of columns? Very strange issues with this format documentation.

Will follow up later.

Hope this helps

Hello Mark,

There are some point to clarify concerning the files I sent.
I first used a tool called FEmodeler in ansys workbench to generate an ANSYS APDL  compatible file format. in this case i get the following lines:

(1i8,3e20.9e3)
       1   -5.275432596E+002    2.714208770E+002    3.333333333E+002 

I then open the file in Ansys APDL, and convert it in a .CDB file. the format is then changed as below:

(3i9,6e20.13)
        1        0        0-5.2754325960000E+02 2.7142087700000E+02 3.3333333330000E+02

the problem with the APDL converter is that if there are 0's among your coordinates it will erase them.

so if 3e stands for 3 columns of floating points, what about 6e???
I am sending both original files for reference.

This was reported by an LLNL user. He also has another ticket in the system regarding eigenvector display issues (#997)
The current eigenvector expression returns the vectors in a matrix, with individual eigenvectors in each column. This makes plotting the individual vectors using the [] operator incorrectand inconsistent with visit documentation. You would have to take the transpose of the result from the eigenvector function, and then use the [] operator on the transpose. Does the visit team think that this is a problem?If so, is this going to be fixed?If not, the documentation should be fixed. It would be bad to have someone chasing non-existent code bugs because of this.

The query over time fails with this error message:VisIt: Error - Curve:  viewer: Curve requires  Lines  plot data.
Investigation revealed that the DataBinning operator is the 'terminal' netnode in the pipeline, so it's UpdateDataObjectInformation method is called after the same method for avtQueryOverTimeFilter.  This is bad due to DataBinning setting output topological dimension, which conflicts with the topological dimension needed by avtCurveConstructorFilter (and which is set properly by avtQueryOverTimeFilter).
If instead of using the operator-created-var route I create the plot like this:    AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""pressure"")    AddOperator(""DataBinning"")
Then avtQueryOverTimeFilter is the terminal node as it should be,and query-over-time runs successfully.

Dear all,
I use visit 2.12.2 to visualize timeseries of 2d/3d fields, usually inthe XDMF format. I write each field with its time stamp.While in Paraview the time slider always shows the ""real"" time stamp ofthe data set, visit seems to ignore this information. In the plotlegends (e.g. of pseudocolor plots), it says ""Time: 0"".
I attach a simple XDMF/H5 test case. The XDMF file has the time information:
<Time TimeType=""List"">    <DataItem Format=""XML"" Dimensions=""10""> 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.60.7 0.8 0.9</DataItem></Time>
Is this the intended behavior?Is there another way to import the time stamps?
Thanks, best wishes

Dear VisIt developper,
Hope it's the good place to report some bug I've experienced on VisIt. If not, please send it to the right place.
I'm using Visit 2.12.2 on Windows and I've got some issue when making a movie with low opacity Iso surface. Same problem occurs when I choose low opacity value on iso volume.
The animation plug-in craches when the opacity value is set up low. Error message is: Scalable Render Request Failed (VisItException) viewer.exe: Obtained null data reader for rendered image for engine W7RDTLCSM42.ifremer.fr.
Notice that I've made nice movies with no issue setting up the opacity value to 100% or opacity to fully opaque. You will find attached an exemple of the plot I've.

BTW, preventing duplicate entries in the list is a performance hit, too. To prevent dups, we need to keep list sorted after each and every update or do linear search upon each update. That didn't appeal given the list can grow to 10^4 entries quite easily on dbs with large numbers of vars. In addition, all current consumers of ExpressionList object do work to prevent dups anyways. Well, it looks like all but Volume plot. They all do linear searches of the list contents.
Those places of code should probably be revisted to use newer/faster API. We should probably add a ticket to audit this throughout VisIt. I changed the places I happen to see/encounter but didn't send out an active search party to find all of them ;)

Currently, we only have the ability to clear all picks. GrizIt supports creating an on-screen selection that highlights selected nodes / zones. For example to remove a single element, they are currently maintaining bookkeeping on their end so they can clear all picks, then re-pick all elements except the element they want remove.
Proposed solution is to create a new method that uses the pick designator (letter) as a unique identifier to locate and remove the pick actor / tab from the UI.

Recently, I got complaints that there were massive memory leaks in my implementation of load balancing (a pretty understandable complaint), so I am now going back to fix things. I got most of them, but there is one small memory leak in silo that I am not sure about. In valgrind, we see that the memory leak occurs in silo_hdf5.c 4927, in the function db_hdf5_process_file_options. The line is: if (NULL == (udata = (db_hdf5_H5LT_file_image_ud_t *)malloc(sizeof(db_hdf5_H5LT_file_image_ud_t)))). In my ALE3D code, I have astd::vector<char> which contains some bytes ( an in-memory hdf5 file ) that were sent from one processor to another. I am taking those bytes and making them into a silo file again as follows:

 int file_len = (int)fileBytes.size();
 char *fileBytesChar = (char *)malloc(file_len);
 std::copy(fileBytes.begin(), fileBytes.end(), fileBytesChar);
 int fic_vfd = DB_H5VFD_FIC;
 DBAddOption(core_opts, DBOPT_H5_VFD, &fic_vfd);
 DBAddOption(core_opts, DBOPT_H5_FIC_SIZE, &file_len);
 DBAddOption(core_opts, DBOPT_H5_FIC_BUF, fileBytesChar);
core_opts_id = DBRegisterFileOptionsSet(core_opts);

 /* Ok, now have Silo open this buffer */

So, I am doing a lot of 1D stuff for ATPESC. That means curve plots.If I hit the 'play' button, VisIt rips through everything really fast (which is nice) but then loops around to frame zero and does everything again, and agian, and again, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again, and agian, and again, and again (I think you get my point).
Hitting the stop button does NOT have immediate effect.
Over moderately slow net, it winds up queueing up a slew of screen updates and you need to wait forever for all that to drain out.
By changing defalt to not loop but just once, would fix most of this issue

The pseudocolor plot legend may have the wrong limits when the clip operator is applied. This is because the clip operator has an optimization where domains that are completely outside the clip range are not read in, causing the min, max calculation to be wrong since it doesn't have all the data. Should we only do this optimization of the database has the min/max in it? Should we eliminate it? Should we make it user controllable?
This is very confusing to users (and may take developers a while to figure out).

I think the ""Use Current Plot"" and ""Use Original Data"" settings for ""Limits"" in the Pseudocolor attributes are confusing. ""Use Current Plot"" means to use the limits of the visible geometry for setting the limits. This isn't what I was expecting. I was thinking more along the lines of the ""Original Data"" vs ""Actual Data"" that is used in the queries, where Original means the same as it does in the Pseudocolor plot, and Actual means the result of the operators being applied.

Forgetting for a moment the mapping of colors to magnitudes, it is the case that the solution should be symmetric about the edge at which those two front-facing faces meet, e.g., the temperatures at F and H are the same, as are those at G and I.  This symmetry is represented nicely by the contour representation, and definitely not by the pseudocolor . . .
MultiresControl only lets me change set resolution=0 or 1, and its doesnt make any difference in the PC plot.
Attached are one of the original figures I sent you (from last Friday), and a figure I just generated.  Note that the one from today is nice and symmetric about the field maximum; I generated it by applying ExternalSurface+SubdivideQuads to the PC.  I am kind of wondering if you (i.e., the Visit team) can combine these into a high accuracy option in the PC plot attributes . .

I run into a problem on Mac where we build HDF4 and NETCDF as shared libraries. When I try and read an Exodus file, the mdserver crashes. Run visit -o foo.exo
Apparently, things are going fine through the NETCDF library and then when trying to call NC_var_shape, the mdserver crashes. The reported crash is inside libmfhdf.dylib, which is an HDF4 shared library! That file is defining some NETCDF functions!!! IT seems to me that HDF4 should not be defining HDF4 functions. Also, we don't link the Exodus or NETCDF readers with HDF4. IF we load any HDF4 plugins (like Enzo or ZeusMP) then the NC_var_shape from HDF4 is being called instead of the symbol from libnetcdf.6.dylib.
Maybe libmfhdf could be patched in build_visit so it does not define NETCDF symbols.

A non-conforming mesh is a mesh where the nodes of one edge may end in the middle of another edge or face. These happen in block structured AMR meshes and in unstructured meshes being used for general adaptivity. Nodes in such meshes are often called hanging nodes.
Data producers can produce continuous fields on such mesh under piecewise linear interpolation by constraining dofs on hanging nodes. However, Visit's expression system cannot, in general, re-produce this continuity for expressions involving the original continuous fields in non-linear ways. The picture below shows the issues.

Left: x (blue) and y (red) contours of continous components of a vectorMiddle: Contour plot of the magnitude of the vector as computed by VisIt's expression system.Right: Contour plot of the magnitude of the vector as computed by data producer and with same continuity constraint enforcement as in original fields, namely that the dofs at the hanging node must be the average of the dofs at the ends of the longer edge it shares.
There are a couple of options...


Here are a couple of options to consider going forward...
	
Define 'constrained' nodes for a ucd var in Silo
	
This would be an optional object to associate with a field in Silo such that it defines, for each node, whether the node is constrained in some way and, if so, the constraint expression. So, for the case you had, the constraint would look like 0.5*Ni+0.5*Nj where Ni and Nj are node ids in the mesh. If the constraints for all fields on the mesh would be the same, we can associate the constraints with the ucdmesh object and not with ucd vars These constraints could then be applied by any expression VisIt performs resulting in continuous fields.


Create a 'conforming mesh' operator that takes a non-conforming mesh and turns it into a conforming mesh
	
Given no information, it would have to find nodes that are ""hanging"" nodes and then subdivide neighoring zones to make them conforming. Finding hanging nodes might be difficult in general. So, this might require that the input mesh at least be annotated in some way to indicate which nodes in the mesh are non-conforming This already has some precedent in VisIt where, for example, we take arbitrary polyhedral zones and subdivide into zoo-type zones.

We have prefs to, for example, enable or disable generation of vector magnitude expressions.
A user would like t the ability to control the default state of these via flags in the database itself. In particular, he would like to disable creation of vector magnitude expressions by setting some flag in the database. The reason is that his mesh is a non-conforming mesh and the expressions computed by VisIt will be discontinuous whereas the same fields created by the data producer will be continuous. He would like to avoid users stumbling into the wrong representation for such fields.

I've attached data, session file to this ticket to demonstrate issues with big quads (e.g. quads that are way bigger than a pixel).
See attached picture.  This is a case where all the nodal values are zero except the center value which is 10.0.

In the attached picture, the cases are, left to right...
Left: Big quads where VisIt decides diagonals,Middle: Big quads but re-interpolated onto a finer mesh to show what the underlying piecewise linear function should look likeRight: Big quads where I decided the diagonals.
On each picture, I show pseudocolor in gray scale and contours in red.


Note following artifacts of left image...
	
The pc shading is assymetric even though the underlying function is symmetric
The contours don't even don't even extend into half of all the quads.

Note that contours in left image more closely match correct image (middle) for contours closer to the middle but less closely match for controus near the outside. OTOH, the reverse is true for the right image contours.

Tom Shepard reported that restoring view port settings doesn't work. Here is his e-mail.
Eric,
As far as I have ever known, VisIT has always lacked the ability to save the viewport settings for Curve view and 2D view to persist between sessions. This is very annoying because the default settings always cause overlap between the graphics content and the Legend, Database, and Time annotations. Every time I start up VisIT, I have to manually open Controls -> View and change the Viewport from 0.2 0.95 0.15 0.95 to 0.25 0.95 0.1 0.9. There is no Make default button as there is for every other Control. If I set the Viewport as I want it and then do Options -> Save Settings, then the new settings do get written to ~/.visit/config; however, when I start up VisIT again, the viewport settings are still 0.2 0.95 0.15 0.95.
Can you please fix this?

Here is the e-mail from Per Persson with the bug report.
I'm doing some testing of volume plots and have found what seems to be a bug.
In the Volume plots dialog, on the 1D transfer function tab, I select color table 'difference'. The blue-white-red color scheme is then shown with three markers - one at the left end (blue), one in the middle (white), and one at the right end (red). Then I go to the commands dialog, clear the code box and start recording. I go back to the 1D transfer function settings and press Apply. Then I stop recording. Among the recorded code I see
VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(0).colors = (0, 0, 255, 255)VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(0).position = 0VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(1).colors = (255, 255, 255, 255)VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(1).position = 0.5VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(2).colors = (255, 0, 0, 255)VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.GetControlPoints(2).position = 1VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.smoothing = VolumeAtts.colorControlPoints.Linear
Now I press the Execute button in the Commands dialog. Suddenly a yellow marker appears between the white and the red color in the color scheme.
Im using VisIt 2.10.0 but have also confirmed this behaviour in 2.12.3.

These are generated using Libsim.
There are two issues (after loading both time states: pseudocolor->rho): 1.) When you move to the second time step, the surface is not completely rendered.      If you hit Reopen and Draw, the surface fully appears.
2.) If you Reopened on the second time step, then go back to the first time step, an error throws:Pseudocolor: ()viewer: Tried to access 97 of 97.

I investigated the visit avtVTKFileReader class and I identified the problem. VisIt expects the file containing the descriptions of all the blocks in each time step to have the extents for each block, when this information can also ( I think always )  be contained in the .vti file.  Before converting the data set to a rectilinear grid, I check if the extent VisIt uses is NULL and I ask the dataset what its extents are. This fixes the problem.
This is mainly a reminder to pull the fix of my branch and put it in the trunk.

I think we're a bit over-zealous in how we handle ""special"" characters in variable names.
The original intention (and expedient solution) was to avoid variable names that would have characters in them that conflict with parsing in VisIt's expression system.
But, not everyone uses the expression system and, even better, we could simply improve the parsing there to deal properly with these cases. In fact, I thought we even now have the ability to ""escape"" parsing using the '<' and '>' surrounding a variable name in expressions.
So, I am not even sure now why we have such tight constraints on characters in variable names.
The current list of forbidden characters is

 \n\t@#:[]<>(){}

Can we review continued need for forbidden chars?

VisIt has about 30 HDF5 based plugins.  HDF5 library wide resources (e.g. properties, file descriptor space etc.) wind up often being shared among them. Its very*easy to wind up coding an HDF5 plugin that negatively effects other HDF5 plugins or causes loss of file descriptors. For example, I just caught this error from the SAMRAI plugin...

The compute engine running on host rzalastor2.llnl.gov issued the following warning:
The HDF5 library indicates the plugin has left the following objects in the file open...
    Internal plugin error: 1 objects left open in file: 
    ""/processor.00003/level.00000/patch.00003/materials/air1_01/air1_01-fractions"" (id=83886080)

Shortly thereafter, the following occured...

The compute engine running on host rzalastor2.llnl.gov issued the following warning:
Error closing HDF5 SAMRAI file ""/g/g11/miller86/tmp/bdry-examples/matghosts/visit_dump.00000/processor_cluster.00003.samrai"".
The file may have been left open holding HDF5 resources. This may indicate a problem with the SAMRAI plugin or some other HDF5
based plugin that has attempted to open this file. Please contact VisIt developers if the problem persists.

To detect conditions like this, any HDF5 plugin should include 'visit-hdf5.h' just after hdf5.h. In fact, is is the very use of visit-hdf5.h that permitted VisIt to detect the above problem in SAMRAI to begin with. So, I occasionally make a pass to check that all our HDF5 plugins are using visit-hdf5.h. Doing that just now shows that
visit-hdf5.h is MISSING from the following plugins.

I got a data set from an AMR simulation and when I do a plot it gets killed by the out of memory controller. I looked into it and it is in the code calculating ghost zones.

Fady gave me a data set that replicates the problem very consistently. Open the file, create a filled boundary plot, a pseudocolor plot and another filled boundary plot. I will go into scalable rendering mode. Hide the second filled boundary plot, all is ok and it is still in scalable rendering mode. Hide the pseudocolor plot and VisIt goes out of scalable rendering mode and it puts up an empty bounding box and has the database as <unknown>. To get back to the correct image you have to do a reopen. He reports several people are having this problem and I know it is an issue for Kevin Roe.
I actually believe it is fairly easy to replicate by adding plots until VisIt switches into scalable rendering and then hiding plots until it goes out of scalable rendering.

The problem is that the plugin summarily populates database metadata without regard for whether the file open actually succeeded. If it conditioned the population of metadata on a successful file open, then it could return empty metadata in cases where the file is not a ProtienDatabank file and VisIt would recognize that the plugin is probably not the right one to use for the given file (even though the extensions matched).
Next, even a GetMesh call succeeds and returns NULL from this plugin.
This behavior had us convinced the file was indeed a ProteinDatabank file even though later analysis proved that it wasn't.

2945,Pending,Bug,Normal, mdserver hangs when using machine-specific host profile during File Open ,-,-,-,Kathleen Biagas,10/23/2017,,0%,,10/23/2017 07:42 pm,11/09/2017 12:51 pm,2 - Rare,3 - Major Irritation,2.12.3,,,Windows,Any,"
The Windows installer creates a host profile for the machine on which it is installed, if the parallel components are installed. This allows the parallel-engine chooser to launch.
If user attempts to use this profile via the file open window, VisIt will attempt to launch another mdserver, and this launch hangs.
I ran across this testing client-server.  I used the file open window to gain access to data on the LC.  I then wanted to open data on my local machine. So I used the named profile for my machine from the 'host' dropdown, instead of 'localhost'.  This caused VisIt to attempt to launch an mdserver, and this mdserver launch never completed.  I had to cancel the launch.

In many expressions, there is a notion of a fill value (what value to use in places on the mesh where there is no answer). Resample, enumerate, map, cmfes, and I assume other functions have this notion too.
But, some expressions methods support passing it in as an arg (pos_cmfe). Some do not but then set it to -1 (map) or to -FLT_MAX (resample).
This should be audited and unifed across the expression interface. In particular, all methods should support specification of the fill vallue or, perhaps, allow the setting of the default fill value in prefs or in some attrs global to all expressions, or both.
Finally, VisIt already supports a notion of missing data from database plugins. This is handled as a sentinel value within a variable set aside to indicate a zone or node where the data is missing, not-known, etc. Shouldn't the expression system really just leverage this concept when it creates variables requiring fill?

VisIt is only reading material information for the first block in a multi-block dataset, and populating that information for all blocks.
Zachary Dodson reported this on the users list, his use case was .pvtu data, but I tested with other forms of multi-block vtk datasets, and it is reproducible no matter the underlying type.
I created a two-block unstructured grid dataset with 'material' scalar. The first block contains material values 0 and 1, the second block contains material values 2 and 3. (test_mat_noids)
File information when opening the .pvtu lists only material 0 and 1.
I then created a second dataset duplicating the first, but this time I also added 'MaterialIds' as FieldData to each block containing all material values for the entire dataset (eg, 0, 1, 2, 3). (test_mat_withids)

I ran into this with the test suite queries/queriesOverTime/AllTimeQueries_02. The volume over time query returns a curve that is nearly constant (24.9999999999 to 25.0, I don't recall the exact number of 9s, but it is a lot). No labels appear and the actual line may disappear as well. If you start to zoom out the labels will appear and the line will consistently show up (24.999999 to 25.000001 I believe). I believe this is a floating point issue and also related to the maximum number of digits that the axes will display. I believe to truly fix this, the data for curve plots will need to be scaled to a reasonable range and then the labels adjusted.

VisIt only uses the material information contained in the first block, so if subsequent blocks have different materials than the first, VisIt will not know about them.
This can currently be overcome by adding an integer FieldData array to the first block called 'MaterialIds' listing all the material ids for the entire dataset.
Should we investigate a better way?

The engine supports a cool option to save logs only from some processors using a processor stride argument.
However, we should always save rank 0 logs because that rank contains a lot more information about what VisIt engine is deciding to do.

If you create a mesh, pseudocolor of u, and label plot of u from multi_rect2d.silo and zoom into the edge of the mesh you will see that the labels will get cut off at the edge of the mesh when scalable rendering is set to always. If you change it to never the labels will appear. I assume that when the image compositing is being done, there must be some strangeness with the z values outside of the mesh and pseudocolor plot.

The SPCTH reader subclasses the MTMD file format which requires all time steps and domains to be in a single file. However, in addition to supporting this the SPCTH reader needs to support MTSD file formats. This should be doable by creating a special file extension to indicate that the SPCTH reader should not treat the file as a data file but a file containing a list of MTSD files that should be processed together.

Hi Praveen,
I wonder if old settings (likely qt-4 based) are undermining things.
Can you try running visit noconfig and see if it does a better job?
from the path to the app bundle you can run:
VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/visit -noconfig

We support the concept of missing data in VisIt and several readers can serve up missing data.
However, for those readers that do not, there is no work-around. A solution is to add an expression that can create missing data on a mesh.
No on has requested this though a recent email on visit-users inspired the thought.

Somehow, 'filename' ends up as 'ilename'.
AFAICT, the rangeOutput MapNode as it exists on the viewer has 'filename', but the MapNode for rangeOutput retrieved by visitmodule:visit_GetPickOutputObject has 'ilename' instead.

We have seen this off and on, it would be good to get to the bottom of what creates these bad symlinks, or some how harden our cmake use to ignore them.

This was reported by a user in .mil domain, Walters, Richard Richard dot I dot Walters at erdc dot dren dot mil

FWIW ... We have discovered that we can only establish a successful client-server connection if, and only if, 
we throw a  -debug flag of 1 or greater onto the executable launch command.  If we do not, then we get to
the point where we would be presented with options for number of nodes, number of processes per node,
time requested, BANK number etc ...  THAT dialog does not present itself unless we execute with:

% visit -debug X

Where X is one or greater ...

This was changed for multiple visit versions (2.12.3,  2.12.1,  etc ) when I upgraded to MAC OS X 10.13.2 ...

I wonder if we have something like

<pre>
debug1 << do-some-real-work << end;

which would cause @do-some-real-work@ to not be called unless debug level 1 was activiated.

I have a dataset with a single point in it. When it is rendered the viewing bounds are a point - ie. the min and the max are the same. This causes the issue.
I have seen a similar issue when rendering a series of points but then doing a subsection that results in a single point. I have not been able to successfully replicate the issue (mostly as I was not sure of the cause and it was with the selection). But I can with the single point data file.  I have attached test dataset with one and two points.
Having a single point affects the view and the bounding box so I am not sure how to solve the issue.

Matt Obrien reported that with code he has mixed materials with material specific values. Normally VisIt always displays the whole zone values unless some material selection is being performed. If there are no materials being selected there is a setting that forces material interface reconstruction and allows seeing the per material values. Neither of these mechanisms appear to be working. I couldn't verify this since none of our test data sets appear to have per material values for variables (or at least none that I could find). The first step is to modify the curv2d.silo generator to put out material specific values for the density that are markedly different so that we can test this. Then we should get this working.

Dear All,
just a short question about missing library dependencies in buildingVisIt2.13.0 using the build_visit2_13_0.txt-script (downloaded 31st ofJanuary 2018):
Initially, the installation of VisIt 2.13.0 on my linux machine wassuccessful: ('All indications are that VisIt successfully built').
However on starting the executable (visit2.13.0/src/bin/visit) I got thefollowing massages:
Running: gui-dvRunning: viewer ...error while loading shared libraries: libvtkjsoncpp-6.1.so.1 ...cannot open shared object..
after which the execution halted.
Checking with ldd on the library dependencies of the files (eg. viewer,but also others) it turns out thatabout five vtk-related libraries are not linked (see attached output ofldd - some of the other vtk-libraries are linked, however), although theyare present in the vtk-directories created by the build_visit2_13_0.txt-script.
Checking on the web it appears that this issue was also observed forthe parallel version of VisIt.
Since the built-script is quite impressive - do you have anysuggestion where to add these missing library dependencies into thebuild_visit2_13_0.txt script?
Built-Log-file (build_visit2_13_0.txt_log.gz) and the output of ldd isattached (visit_libraries.txt).
The machine is a standard desktop PC (Intel CPU, OS: opensuse 42.3,Linux kernel 4.4.103-36).
If you need further information, please let me know.
Any help is appreciatedUdo v. Toussaint

A customer developing a new plot plugin wants his plugin to set the variable units displayed by the legend.This can be done during CustomizeBehavior by a call to avtPlot::SetVarUnits.
However, ViewerPlot::CreateActor also calls SetVarUnits, and this is done after avtPlot is finished executing, so the ViewerPlot call overrides the settings done by the plot plugin.
Anyone know why ViewerPlot does this?
There is also logic in avtPlot::Execute to set the units if they are available, so it seems ViewerPlot duplicates functionality as well as preventing plugins from changing the setting.

Marina Bastea created a scatter plot and a curve plot in 2d in a single window. When she saves the images using non-screen capture, only fragments of the curves show up in the saved image. I assume this is some sort of ice image compositing bug. When I ran it serial or with 2 processors it saved properly, but when I ran with 36 processors I got the same behavior as Marina. I was able to reproduce this be creating a curve file from a lineout and then combining a plot of that with a scatter plot of d vs p with curv2d.silo.

To summarize our conversation, it would be nice to have an option in VisIt to compute the signed distance function of an STL file.

Dear all;
Maybe this has come across someone who can give me a pointer in the right direction.
The behavior is somewhat obscure:
Im on osx (10.13) with a recent (svn) version of visit.   I can open sources and add plots.   But the render/viewer window stays blank until I resize the window, or change the screen (3-finger left-right swipe) and back.   If I manipulate (e.g. rotate) the plot, the viewer/render window is not updated until I resize the window or change the screen.   This is somewhat mildly annoying.
I had a look in vtkqt and the ViewerWindow but was not able to find the culprit for this behavior.   I suspect it has something to do with the vtkRenderWindow.
It would be great if anyone knew where to look.
Thanks and best regards,   Christoph Statz

I have a 130K dataset that is 1.6Gb and plot3d. It has a ton of small 9x9x9 domains (not ideal). When I run on a Mac with 64Gb memory using 8 engines, I see memory usage get huge to the point that the machine runs out of memory and freezes up.
I was making a Subset plot of domains and forcing SR mode before clicking the Draw button. I noted in top that the viewer at some point grows to beyond 15Gb of memory usage. We're supposed to be sending it an SR image, which should not require that kind of memory usage.
I later reduced the number of domains to 1/2 using the Subset window and used the Mac's Instruments program to measure viewer memory allocations. I found that 1) the parallel axis colleague in the vis window is trying to create 130k axes and we're not even in parallel coordinates mode and 2) the legend for the Subset window is creating 130K text actors for the legend.
I have a fix for number 1.

I was running VisIt with a dataset that had 130K domains and I made a Subset plot of domains. Things were taking a long time so VisIt saved out a crash recovery session file with 130K colors in the Subset plot attributes, which was sloooow.

This state object is used for plots such as Subset. Internally, it stores colors as a vector of ColorAttribute objects. For Subset on datasets with large numbers of domains (130K), this is a bad way to represent colors (too many small memory allocations). We should rethink the object's internal representation so it:
	
Can allocate memory in a large block.
Maybe only stores differences from the typical repeated implicit color pattern.
Just store differences to the implicit color pattern in the session files and configs.

I recently made a customlaucher to hijack an existing sbatch/mpirun launcher to run a different launcher. I did this because the menu in the Host profiles window shows a fixed list of launchers/sublaunchers.
I think it'd be nice if we set some VISIT_LAUNCHERS environment variable in the internallauncher based on the registered job submitter classes and then use the contents of that environment variable to add to the list of launchers in the Host Profile's launcher menu.

Qt 5.10.x seems to solve all of the issues that we've had to add workarounds for in OS X (and potentially other systems too). We should consider upgrading to Qt 5 as soon as possible.
From Gunther:    Hi another reference point,
I am building VisIt on MacOS X 10.13.3, though not with VisIt's own Qt but a Qt installed through HomeBrew. For a long time, I had problems with toolbars not showing up properly (despite the workarounds Kevin added a while back). I also encountered odd rendering problems etc.
However, once HomeBrew transitioned to Qt 5.10 all of these problems disappeared. I am currently using Qt 5.10.1 and could remove the workarounds of using ""QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_ImmediateWidgetCreation)"" in vtkqt/vtkQtRenderWindow.C and all toolbars still show up as they are supposed to do. It seems that this Qt version fixed a couple of problems that were causing this issues.
If there are no other issues holding us back, updating from Qt 5.6 to 5.10 may solve a lot of problems we are encountering. PySide2 seems to be at least working on an implementation for Qt 5.10, though I am not sure if that is in production, yet.
Gunther
From Kathleen:Looks like on the dev version of pyside2 they are working on support qt5.11 so I think we should be good to uprade qt to 5.10.
Still no official releases, though.

I noticed quite a but of use of QLabel->setBuddy() in GUI and initially, this made a lot of sense to me because I had assumed making some other Qt widget the ""buddy"" of a QLabel would offer some conveniences such as if you ->hide() the widget, it would also hide the buddy label.
Turns out the setBuddy has a very specific semantic http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qlabel.html#setBuddy, and should be used only when accelerator keys are being specified. This is not the way we appear to be using it for in >90% of places setBuddy is being used in our GUI code. I suspect this may be due to prolific use of cut-n-paste or perhaps a hold over from an older meaning of setBuddy in earlier versions of Qt.

We had some users running into trouble with build_visit on Fedora ultimate related to openssl with Qt.
The solution was to add --no-openssl to Qt build. But, we don't wanna do that in general. Only when its absolutely necessary. This is because SeedMe needs it. Currently, SeedMe is not a bonafied build_visit package and is instead a sub-package in python build. So, build_visit really has no knowledge about whether it is or is NOT being requested in a build. So, there is no way to condition --no-openssl in Qt on basis of SeedMe. When python packages are promoted to fully first class packages in build_visit, then we could do business that way.
The solution here may be to just add an env. variable such as DO_QT_OPENSSL that a build_visit invoker can set to control this.
Below is the patch that our users came up with to bv_qt.sh to get things to build on Fedora.

We currently use uname -s to distinguish OPSYS in build_visit.
uname with -s option doesn't really distinuish sufficiently among Linux variants though. For example, it can't distinguish between Fedora, RedHat, Ubuntu, etc. And, we often need logic in the script(s) that does make that distinction

There are a slew of places in VisIt where we assume an int is sufficient size type to index buffers or to iterate a loop counter, etc. of node or zone-centered data. Thats fine if we never have a mesh with more than 2^31-1 nodes or zones. Rectilinear cases of larger sizes are quite common nowadays I think.
It looks like VTK data objects can themselves support single instances of these sizes. They are using vtkIdType everywhere.
We need to make an audit throughout VisIt to fix this.
In the past, we've argued that if you are going big, you are probably also going parallel and in that case, no single block is ever that large. But, with faster systems, with GPUs and with larger memories, cases where single large block of this size are going to become more common, I think.

Select Geometry tab of PC plot attrs and set Point type to any of the 3D glyph types like SphereGeometry
check the box to Scale point size by variable and then select the variable ""hmax""

Maybe adjust the Point size scale factor a bit to and confirm its behaving as expected
Ok, now use Data Level Comparison wizard to create a cmfe from ""p"" of rect2d.silo onto the one and only mesh in this file
Change the plotted variable to the cmfe you have created
The plot goes totally white. The PC color gets lost. To confirm, open Annotation Attributes and set background color to something dark, like dark blue or something.
you see white circles that vary in size but no pseudocoloring.
Change Point type back to sphere or point and the pseudocolor re-appears.

I suspect this has to do with secondary variable setting in the pipeline when cmfe is in force.
That said, you can make a cmfe (for laughs) in which the donor variable and target mesh are already on the same mesh in this database and you do*not lose pseudocoloring.

Likewise, if 2 of the dimensions are 1, it means the mesh is representing line elements.
So, heres the rub thoughHow does one represent in Silo a structured collection of quads in 3 space (e.g. a surface of quads in 3 space).
Silos DBPutQuadmesh call expects that number of dimensions specifies both the topological arrangement of nodes/zones and the geometric interpretation in terms of number of coordinate components. Thats limiting!
Those two ideas should be de-coupled.
So, to get around this issue, a caller would specify ndims=3 (achieving the desired 3-component coordinate) but then specify one of the dimension sizes as 1 ensuring they are treated as surface elements instead.
This is a hackish way to model a structured surface of quads embedded in 3 space. But, it kinda sorta does work.
Silos API is over 20 years old at this point

This is requested by LLNL Engineering (not GrizIt team though) and favored by LLNL WCI.
Currently, if a multi-block variable is defined on only some blocks, the data producer is required (by VisIt not by Silo) to create a cooresponding multi-block mesh object with the same missing blocks. This cause the data producer to create mesh objects representing various subset configurations that are otherwise easily defined/constructed by SIL restrictions. In the new approach, a data producer will be allowed to create a single multi-block mesh object and then define upon it multi-var objects that have missing/empty blocks.


We should decide on best approach for how VisIt will then treat a missing variable block. Some options considered so far are...
	
Missing variable blocks get filled with a fill value (where data producer and visit user can select fill value)
Missing variable blocks are treated essentially as transparent (ghosted away)
Missing variable blocks are colored specially (e.g. kinda like greyed out where data producer or visit user can select color)
	
This approach requires some color be set aside from the normal colormaps that can easily distinguish the block from normal data.


Missing blocks impose a modified SIL restriction such that the missing blocks are turned off in the SIL and also grey'd out in the SIL controls window.
	
Works fine when SIL is different for each plot (e.g. not using Apply SIL to all plots option)


I think it may make sense to support all of these appraoches in VisIt's interface(s) so that users can vary behavior as needed.

Josh Kallman demoed this issue to me on both VIsIt 2.13.0 and 2.13.1 on LC.
He has a a 2d dataset.
He adds and draws a filled boundary plotHe adds and draws a mesh plot
Then he hides the mesh plot.
At this point VisIt switches into a 3D view mode and the extents are garbage -- nothing is shown.(I know its 3D b/c the triad appears and you can move it)

While I was working on a script to help anyone slurp png files from the NERSC web server where our results are posted (and which is where the current PNGs can be obtained) and re-baseline from those as opposed to re-running the test suite somewhere....
I discovered there is a small gotcha in our post process. When we generate the HTML pages for test results, we put all the png files in a single dir, dropping the category and py file sub-dir paths that might otherwise distinguish them. Long story sort, if any two .py files have a Test(""<result-file-name>"") with the same result file name, those will collide during the post process and I suspect last writer wins.
So far, I think we've just gotten lucky except for csg_0[1-8].png in baseline/meshtype/csg and csg0[1-8] in baseline/simulation/csg which appear to have been manually intentionally de-collided precisely to avoid this collision. We should probably adapt Test() method to prepend category and/or py filename to the files to ensure we avoid this issue

This is something that should be optional and off by default because it would involve problem-sized work on every mesh a plugin hands back to VisIt.
But, in engineering world, its very common to handle zoo elements as degenerate hexs. For example a 4 node tet is 4 nodes followed by the same 4 nodes.
An engineering user had some mix-cell-type meshes with all 8-node elements some of which are true hexahedra and some of which are tets stored as degenerate hexs and we don't handle this well.
Since this is a faily common practice in engineering codes, it probably makes sense to have a transform operation that handles it. We could have controls to enable it (maybe in prefs though it is more like a global database read option). We could also have a data producer indicate its need by using some kind of a convention in the input file which would be easy to define for Silo format but may require effort for various other data formats.

# Grab the control points list from the desired color table, ""Reds"" here

# Grab the Volume plot attributes, and clear out the color control points 
va = VolumeAttributes()
va.colorControlPoints.ClearControlPoints()

# For each control point in the color table, add it to the volume atts color control points 
for i in range(0, redsct.GetNumControlPoints()):

So, it looks like something is amiss in the automated testing harness. I know Kathleen has been trying to debug. I won't have any cycles to look until friday.
Problem is that it runs as Eric, we have no way to stop or otherwise control it and Eric won't have a chance to look at it until he is back from vacation.
So, this suggests we need to have the cron job, file system area, etc. that manages nightly testing that runs as a user 'visit' that we all can access.
Is that possible?

Investigating meshtype regression tests for emptydomains, I noticed a 'highlight' artefact on the pseudocolor plots.
I reproduced the test via the gui and discovered that the Mesh plot is the one causing the artefacts.  If the mesh plot is not added, the Pseudocolor plot renders correctly, but once the Mesh plot is added, the 'highlight' artefact remains, even when all the plots are deleted and Pseudocolor is re-added.
I've attached three images that demonstrate using rect3d:  pc_alone: just the Pseudocolor plot before Mesh plot is added  pc_mesh:  after adding mesh plot, the back top edge appears 'highlighted'  pc_mesh_deleted: after deleting mesh plot, looks like the back face is 'elevated', causing the 'highlight' effect.

There is logic in Mesh Plot's gui window to disable the opaque color options when opaque mode 'auto' and it is deemed 'inappropriate', for example, when another plot is in the window.  However, when that other plot is deleted, and the opaque mode is triggered, the opaque color buttons never get re-enabled.  One has to switch opaqueMode to 'On' in order to change the opaque color.

While creating some tests for reflecting over an arbitrary plane, I noticed a strange issue with rendering multi-domain data in the test suite. The issue was clearest with rect3d vs multi_rect3d (curv3d also showed differences, but they were less extreme). Basically, you can see very pronounced boundary lines in the multi-domain dataset that do not appear in the single domain version. I could not reproduce this when running VisIt directly and opening up multi_rect3d myself; it only appeared when running the test suite.
To repeat:Open up reflect.py in the test suite, and add something like what follows:OpenDatabase(silo_data_path(""multi_rect3d.silo""))AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""d"")DrawPlots()Test(""foo"")
I've attached an image of the result I get when I do the above.

A user defined a curve in a Silo file using multi-block 1D quad meshes but then couldn't plot them as curves.
VisIt has logic to detect 1D quadmeshes and re-interpret them as curves. However, it requires the quadmeshes also be single block.
By removing that logic and allowing a avtCurveMetaData to haven blocks, I've tested this and it works with very minor changes to VisIt internals.
The curve plot behaves strangely when domains are removed in the middle because it winds up connecting the dots across gaps in the curve that would otherwise exist due to domain removal. Removing domains from the ""ends"" of the curve plot works fine.
What should a subset plot of a multi-block curve look like? One idea I had was a banded colored background of the curve plot or a horizontally colored line.
Supporting a multi-block curve object simplifies data producers whose curve data is distributed across multiple MPI ranks.
OTOH, it is very apparent that ""curves"" should not demand as much special handling in Visit as we have for them and we'd be much better off just dealing with them like any other (rectilinear) qualmish except that they are 1D topologically and spatially. If we wound up modifying VisIt everywhere to do that, then this simple fix for curves is not necessary.

A curve is nothing more than a variable on a (rectilinear) quadmesh which is both 1D topologically and spacially.
However, we wind up treating curve objects throughout Visit specially, in plugins, in database metadata, in the SIL.
We can remove all the special case code for curves and simply allow curves to be treated like any other quadmesh/quadvar objects.
In some cases, we may want to ask the quadmesh/quadvar if it meets the requirements to be treated like a curve (1D topologically and spacially) so that we can decide if it should appear in the Curve Plot's menu, etc.
But, otherwise, we should remove all the special case code for curves.

In Silo, time is handled on a sort of per-directory basis.
All the objects in a dir share the same ""time"" or ""dtime"" entry. To have multiple objects in a file with different times associated with them, they each need to go into their own directory.
What really needs to happen is for time to be associated with the object itself sort of embedded within a namespace only the object knows about. In HDF5, this could be easily handled as an attribute on the object. Otherwise, we'd need to extend all objects structures to support a time member.

First, not sure what the rationale is for these categorizations. Second, why are we testing stuff we don't use? When do we actually use these other plugins.


My desire...
	
Make rect a normal plugin...its useful sometimes.
Can we craft the CMakeLists.txt file here so that it produces makefiles for these other plugins always but then either you have to manually cd into those dirs to make those plugins or we provide some additional make targets to make them when we want them?
I mean, why do we have to suffer a re-cmake step to get makefiles for these? Instead of controlling these at cmake-time, lets me it to make time.

I was trying to load CarpetIOHDF5 2D data with visit 2.10 and 2.13. I compiled both on an SL7 box using the build_visit scripts with the --hdf5 option. The 2.13 takes much longer to load.
I loaded up files containing 3,4,5,6,7, 10, and 13 timelevels, respectively. I then measured the time it took from hitting the ""OK"" button of the open file dialog until the main window responded. Here's what I found.
For 2.10.3, it takes about a second to open any of the files.
For 2.13 the time seems to increase at least quadratically with  the number of timelevels

Here is the e-mail chain with a possible fix.
I did some digging on this. Using the same Qt tarball that VisIt downloads, but with a slightly modified configure and build environment, I got it working. It no longer complains about missing fonts, nor does it try to draw negative point size fonts.
I dont have a solid fix yet, but in case someone else tested it, this is what I did:
I took the configure command that bv_qt.sh uses and flipped the --nomake examples and --nomake tests flags to their respective --make flags. The theory here was that it would build its own examples that use text in the GUI and I could see where problems were occurring. I also did the build out-of-source, making a build directory inside qt-everywhere-src-5.10.1/ and running ../configure from within it. I did this external to my working VisIt build, so I also had to manually set the directory in my config-site cmake file.

Ok, unfort. few of us have access to Ubuntu systems to debug this.
I think Trunk version of VisIt is using newer Qt too, right? 5.6.1 vs 5.10.1
Will have to wait until the developer here who does have access to ubuntu will have time to take a look.

Hi Mark,
I was on Ubuntu 16.04 with that error. Ive since had to upgrade the machine to 18.04 and after rebuilding Im seeing the same issue.
Ive successfully built/run/developed VisIt on a few 16.04 machines with no Qt issues before. This one is new to me.

Hi Alok,
What kind of system are you seeing this on?
On OSX, we are seeing some funkiness with Qt and VisIt's GUI...but it is still visible and useable -- just cosmetically not behaving as we'd expect/want.

Hi Alok,
I haven't seen that error before. We have primarily had experience with rhel7, OSX and possibley Windows with the newest version of Qt. Unfortunately, I don't have any advice on how to fix it. Perhaps some other developers more familiar with Qt will chime in.

Hello,
I have rev 33153 of the trunk. Third-party libs and VisIt build successfully (Ubuntu 16.04), but I get Qt font errors at runtime:
QFontDatabase: Cannot find font directory /home/ahota/visit/third_party/visit/qt/5.10.1/linux-x86_64_gcc-5.4/lib/fonts.Note that Qt no longer ships fonts.

The GUI has no visible text on it anywhere. Opening a menu results in the following error printed for each menu item:
QFont::setPointSizeF: Point size <= 0 (-0.750000), must be greater than 0
Creating a fonts directory resolves the first two error messages, but not the negative point size, which I assume is affecting all GUI text. Is this happening for anyone else?

Tecplot has magic to load up a file of 1d variables as x-y curves where every variable is listed against every other variable.
Its a n^2 operation and when the database contains a valid coordinate variable (say ""x"" or ""X"" or ""i' or ""I"" or strcasecmp(""coord"") in the first entry in the list of variables), then this behavior should be disabled and instaed just use that as the coordinate of all the curve plots.

It looks like VisIt is still trying blueprint ahead of silo.
That is probably ok, as long as blueprint quickly decides the file isn't a silo file.
However, it appears to also be  generating error message noise (see below) on stderr (and exceptions in vlog files though I honestly don't know if that is really considered bad form for a plugin that decides it doesn't own the given file. My view is that it is a common thing for a plugin to do that and so should not Except out but can nonetheless log a message about why it decided it didn't own the file)
The HDF5 library can be quite noisey about error conditions, depending on how it is compiled. I dunno if we've got all the right switches set in the way we configure and build HDF5 (honestly, I don't even know if HDF5 library error message verbosity can indeed be controlled at configure time either for 1.8 series or new 1.10).
I do know a call to H5Eset_auto will silence it. I do this in Silo unless a Silo caller has indicated it wants error reporting on stderr.

I tried using build_visit to create static libs with llvm and mesa-as-gl.  Always failed when it came to mesa gl.I've included my notes regarding the build attempts below.  This is for LLVM 5.0.0 and Mesa 17.2.8.
A note about LLVM builds
   * if LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB flag is ON it builds libLLVM.so and libLTO.so, and also creates a lot of static libs
   * if LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB flag is OFF, libLTO.so is still built, but not libLLVM.so, 
     and it builds all of the same static libs as when the flag is on.  
     There is no libLLVM.a
   * if BUILD_SHARED_LIBS flag is ON, all of the libraries are shared

A note about Mesa builds
   * if LLVM is built with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, mesa won't link correctly as it looks for the static component libs which don't exist
   * if LLVM is built with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF, and LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB either off or on, 
     and mesa is configured with --enable-static --disable-shared --disable-llvm-shared-libs, 
     there is a compile/link error for swr:

  CXXLD  libswrAVX2.la
libtool: link: can not build a shared library
libtool: link: See the libtool documentation for more information.
libtool: link: Fatal configuration error.
Makefile:1801: recipe for target 'libswrAVX2.la' failed
make[5]: *** [libswrAVX2.la] Error 1
I don't know if there is another incantation/combination of build flags that will get Mesa to build static libs, or if this is fixed in newer versions of mesa. Note, newer versions require expat2.
In terms of building visit statically, once llvm-mesa problems are fixed, Find modules for LLVM/MesaGL may need to be modified.

Refer to the unix, tee, command-line tool
It would be helpful for developers if we added logic to VisIt's DebugStream initialization code to effectively tee cout and cerr so that we would capture such output in debug logs, syncronously, with other logging activity captured there. But, in so doing, we don't necessarily wanna loose it on cout and cerr...or, maybe its ok if -debug is on the command line to Visit to capture only in debug logs? Probably not as developers probably expect to see printf's on stdout even with -debug in effect.

Al Nichols has some variables he would like to write out that effectively have ghost data that isn't associated with elements. In this case he will be writing out more values for the variable than there are zones. Al would like VisIt to just ignore the extra values. I suspect that there are checks in VisIt that the length matches the number of zone and truncates it and then puts out an error message. Can we support Al's use case.

The actually problem is the view was changing but the axis labels were not.

I think this FAQ item should be reduced to a single line such as, http://visit.ilight.com/svn/visit/trunk/src/databases/ or perhaps that plus a link to the wiki VisIt File Formats page. There is no point in duplicating this information in multiple places.

This is a high priority and would help Randy Settgest a lot.
Also, incredibly simple to add.
We need to add logic to silo plugin to detect non-null for unsigned char *ghost_node_label on a DBucdmesh, DBpointmesh and DBquadmesh and/or unsigned char *ghost_zone_label on a DBzonelist and DBquadmesh object and then set up avtGhostNodes and/or avtGhostZones according to the data found in these arrays. Very easy. But, I don't have time myself.
An early example of Randy's data is attached to this ticket. It could be incorrect data so take care working with it. If you find problems, be sure to inform Randy and iterate with him to correct what is wrong with the data. Also, the Silo package includes some data generation tests, specmix.c that will generate ghost nodes and zones on both ucd and quad meshes (single block though -- but you can at least use it to test that VisIt is ghosting things properly). I've attached a Silo/PDB example of that data to this ticket too.

I was looking at VisWinView::ResetView and the parameters being sent to vtkCamera.  However, I noticed the code is actually never called.
VisWindow::ResetView, which calls VisWinView::ResetView,  is commented out and has been for a very long time.
Funny enough VisWinView::ResetView, was modified as recently as 2012.
Other code that would need changing is VisWinPlots::AdjustCamera, which has logic to call VisWindow::ResetView.
Since the code hasn't been active for such a long time, should it be removed to avoid confusion?

For CMFE from point donor to volumetric target...
Open globe.siloDefine the CMFE...
pos_cmfe(</Users/miller86/visit/trunk/data/silo_hdf5_test_data/noise.silo:PointVar>, <mesh1>, -1000)
replacing the path to noise.silo with appropriate path.
Plot the resulting CMFE with PC plot. You get all -1000 values (e.g. the did-not-overlap value). But, PointVar definiately overlaps with mesh1 in globe.silo so some points should have values in the range of the donar variable, PointVar.
As above is fixed, be sure it also works when volumetric mesh includes arbitrary polyhedral zones.
For CMFE from volumetric donor with arbitrary polyhdral cells to point target, some points wind up getting the did not overlap value when it is believed that every point is belived to be close to the centroid (e.g. middle) of each volumetic cell because that is how the data was constructured. For example data, see /usr/workspace/wsrzc/visit/bug_data/bug_data_3183.7z on RC and compre PC plots of CELLS/mass and POINTS/mass. POINTS/mass has 792 points that get the did not overlap value. The definition of POINTS/mass is an database expression involving a CMFE of CELLS mass.
I think the first of the two would be potentially easier to fix and involve something minor. An alternative may be to remove sanity checks in conn_cmfe that prevent its application to meshes of different topology types. In the case that a point target is believed to be 1:1 with volumetric donor cells, it should still work though it would then also require that points in the point target are ordered identically to cells in the volmetric donor.
I set priority to high as this is important to Mike Owen. If either of these is fixed, I think he will be happy(er)

This impacts conduit and friends.
For performance reasons, conduit enables latest and greatest features in HDF5 library.
However, any conduit software stack using version 1.10 of HDF5 can wind up creating files that 1.8 cannot read.

This is harder than it sounds. When blocks are compressed, their offest in the file is no longer easily predictable. So, you need to store the block-offsets or offset deltas too. Either allocate enough space at the front of the file to store all block offsets for the file (would require foreknowledge of approx. file size), or develop a scheme of storing the block offset data among other data blocks in the file. But, keeping the blocks 7z compressed would alleviate overhead-heavy scenarios.

When turning of the second elment block VisIt gives and error message.
""ERROR: Pseudocolor:  () viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly.""
Is this a know problem with a known workaround?
We have sample data available to demonstrate this issue.
We also had to load  the data without using the Alegra preset in the Exodus reader or it would not even generate a pseudocolor plot.
I have attempted to attach a 2 partition exodus file of 12 elements.If the attachment does not go through, then please contact me for the data.

This was happening for BK running client/server.
	
scratch2 was down and VisIt startups would stall.
The evidence strongly suggests lscratch2 being down was the cause.

Startup started stalling when it went down




Startup was fine running all remote but sessions were too slow for her.
	
I didn't think at the time but I could have tried a VNC connection for her.


She had no visitrc files
We cleared all her path history from the gui on both local and remote
	
I didn't think to check for macros...would those be in config?

From ATPESC:
one of the first symptoms folks see on linux if they have visit binary install that isn't compatible with their system is linking issues with libpng.
In complex cases, system  libpng may actually be using a newer version of zlib than we are, so they have to downgrade their system libpng.
It seems we need to build libpng to avoid this.
Note, in a few cases where this struck users, they just download the first linux binary on our website -- rhel. The easy fix was to use another binaries.  We should make the rhel, ubuntu etc, clearer on the website some how.

I have a dataset, 10 million exodus quad8 zones. A smaller, 5 millon quad8 case works fine.But, engine crashes on 10 million case due to a call to new from VTK of size 18446744071695319403 (which is 64 bit unsigned for -2280735082) . I am pretty sure what is going on here is an int overflow somewhere in VisIt and/or VTK during vtkDataWriter::Write method when writing to a string in avtDataRepresentation::vtkToString() method repeated, with hacks, below
unsigned char*
avtDataRepresentation::vtkToString(bool compress)
{
    if (asVTK == NULL)
        return NULL;

    datasetType = DatasetTypeForVTK(asVTK);

    vtkDataSetWriter *writer = vtkDataSetWriter::New();
    writer->SetInputData(asVTK);
    //writer->SetWriteToOutputString(1);
    {
        static int bar = 0;
        char name[32];
        sprintf(name, ""foo%d.vtk"", bar++);
        writer->SetFileName(name);
    }
    writer->SetFileTypeToBinary();
    writer->Write();
{
    vtkIdType foo = writer->GetOutputStringLength();
    asCharLength = foo;
    if (foo != (vtkIdType) asCharLength)
        cerr << ""Overflow with size "" << foo << endl;
}
    asChar = (unsigned char *) writer->RegisterAndGetOutputString();
    writer->Delete();

Its possible that VTK is failing due to some prior VisIt<->VTK interaction involving the dataset and its size here where an int overflow occurs in VisIt and VisIt turns around and feeds this overflowed int back into VTK. So, Its not entirely clear to me the problem is in VTK. It is just manifesting there. And, when I hack the above block of code to write the data to a file instead of a string, it does not crash. And the size of the resulting file 2280735082 which is -2280735082 upon overflow which matches the data above for the failed new call.
Ordinarily, I would just change int to size_t in avtDataRepresentation. But, the problem is concumsers of that class...I am not sure how many dominoes will fall here and don't have time to investigate further this month.
I've set as high priority because this is a lurker IMHO where size_t needs to be used everywhere we currently use int for size of strings holding serialized VTK datasets and we have a user currently hitting this issue.

A user has 220Mb xml xdmf file for 64,000 hyperslabbed blocks. mdserver was going over 10Gig for it.
Part  of the issue is VisIt and handling of large domain listsThe other part, which I think is at least as bad if not worse than VisIt's domain list problem, is the xml parser used in Xdmf library.
The mdserver is holding on to all this stuff when it doesn't need to. The engine does too.
Perhaps updating to Xdmf3 library would help?

There are some issues with the color and opacity of volume rendering.1. data min and max that visit has cached are incorrect, which causes data to be scaled incorrectly. Easily fixed by finding min and max manually. 2. There are various issues with unstructured datasets. First, VTK can't handle our ""empty space value"", which is replaced with a reasonable value outside of our expected range. This causes interpolation issues.

Many query operations support original vs. actual (as an aside, can we re-visit the rationale for supporting the original option).
I was looking at a massive dataset on a small number of processors by setting SIL restriction to 1-2% of all domains. It worked great....that is as long as I always remembered to set 'actual' before doing any queries. The queries default to original and I accidentally forgot to set to actual before hitting the query button...20 minutes later, I was able to continue work.
I think queries should also be actual by default and original only if requested. At the same time, I am still a tad puzzled why we support the original option anyways.

I recently noticed some strange behavior with visit's operator attributes windows. If you render a plot, add an operator, open the operator attributes window, and then delete all plots, the operator window continues to exist in the background (can see using print statements). What was most surprising is that every window for every operator I plotted continues to exist after it's been deleted. Is this something that we know about?
How to see/repeat behavior:Put some print statements in the ""UpdateWindow"" method of several Qvis operator windows. MakeOpen up visit and add a plot. Add an operator, and open up operator's attributes window. Delete the plot. Repeat for every plot that you put print statements in.
You'll notice that the print statements continue to fire for every operator window you've opened, despite having deleted these previous plots/operators.

Here is the e-mail exchange related to this issue with a Chombo data set.
We should really get to the bottom of this. We have this come up occasionally and never investigate.
Hi Robert,
The scalable rendering request is most likely crashing because VisIt has run out of memory. Most likely, there is an increase in memory usage each time you move to a new time state. There is a data structure that stores neighbor information for ghost zone generation that takes up a particularly large amount of memory that is calculated and replicated across all processors. One outcome of this is that as you increase the number of cores the memory usage for that data structure doesnt decrease. There is an option to use an alternate data structure that takes up less memory. The larger default data structure is only used by the AMR Dual Grid And Stitch Cells operator, which you are probably not using, so using the smaller data structure is probably ok. You can enable this by adding the following to the command line.
-disable-ghosts-for-t-intersections
This might not get rid of the issue completely, but should make the crash less frequent.
I will submit a ticket to look at memory usage over time and have someone investigate this.
Are you using the movie generating wizard or are you using a script? If you are using a script, you could manually close the compute engine every 20 time steps to avoid the crash, this isnt optimal, but better than crashing and automatically restarting. If you are using the movie wizard, a possible option would be to add an option to automatically restart after N time steps.

Hi,
I'm trying to generate a sequence of frames from a Chombo database with VisIt 2.13.0. The frames contain one boundary plot and one volume plot. Occasionally, the rendering fails with the message
VisIt: Error - Scalable Render Request Failed (VisItException)viewer: Obtained null data reader for rendered image for engine login-1-2.fram.sigma2.no
The files are 50-150GB with 5 AMR levels but I get this error message even with a low number of ray samples, no lighting/smoothing, and rendering only on the coarsest AMR level. I've tried anything between 32 and 2048 cores, and this always happens after e.g. 20-100 frames generated. Incidentally, I do not have this problem if the time step is fixed, and I the frames with e.g. different camera angles.
Also, the job step occasionally resumes, the frame then renders successfully, and the process repeats. This is nevertheless a time (and CPU) consuming problem that interrupts my workflow and mood.

Here is the e-mail exchange.
Hi Shaun,
The time state and time value should just be automatically exported when you do an export database to Silo. I tested this with a Silo time sequence and this worked fine. There is clearly a bug involved here and I will submit a ticket to investigate this.
Here are some thoughts on what could be going wrong. There are attributes that the database sets which indicates the reliability of the time state and time values and its possible that the Mili reader isnt setting this properly and then the export database looks at those values and doesnt output it. Assuming this is the case, the Mili reader could be corrected or the export database functionality could be modified to just use the time and value, regardless of whether it is tagged as reliable or not.
We are also in the process of rewriting the Mili reader in collaboration with the Mili developers and its possible that this may also resolve the problem. This has been going on for quite some time, so I dont know when that will be available.
In any case, we will investigate.
