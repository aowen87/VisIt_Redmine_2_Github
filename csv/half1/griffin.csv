    Maybe this has come across someone who can give me a pointer in the right direction.
    
    The ‚Äûbehavior‚Äú is somewhat obscure:
    
    I‚Äôm on osx (10.13) with a recent (svn) version of visit.
    I can open sources and add plots.
    But the render/viewer window stays blank _until_ I resize the window, or change the screen (3-finger left-right swipe) and back.
    If I manipulate (e.g. rotate) the plot, the viewer/render window is not updated until I resize the window or change the screen.
    This is somewhat mildly annoying.
    
    I had a look in vtkqt and the ViewerWindow but was not able to find the culprit for this behavior.
    I suspect it has something to do with the vtkRenderWindow.
    
    It would be great if anyone knew where to look.
    
    Thanks and best regards,

so I mentioned this before, but it‚Äôs getting to be a limitation on the work we‚Äôre trying to do. if we try to sample SPH data to a grid larger than ~200^3, the compute engine goes OOM. this seems to be a problem of allocating the entire lattice on all available processors, and since the processors share a single memory bank (for instance if you run 20 procs on rzalastor), this quickly grows out of bounds of available memory. I know kevin was at one point working on streamlining the operator to use less memory, but have you guys looked yet into completely redesigning the way the grid is handled in parallel? at the moment, just the particle data is partitioned, mapped to a local grid of the size of the entire domain, and then at the end, all local grids are summed together for the global grid.

We should consider upgrading to Qt 5 as soon as possible.

From Gunther:
    Hi another reference point,
    
    I am building VisIt on MacOS X 10.13.3, though not with VisIt's own Qt but a Qt installed through HomeBrew. For a long time, I had problems with toolbars not showing up properly (despite the workarounds Kevin added a while back). I also encountered odd rendering problems etc.
    
    However, once HomeBrew transitioned to Qt 5.10 all of these problems disappeared. I am currently using Qt 5.10.1 and could remove the workarounds of using ""QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_ImmediateWidgetCreation)"" in vtkqt/vtkQtRenderWindow.C and all toolbars still show up as they are supposed to do. It seems that this Qt version fixed a couple of problems that were causing this issues. 
    
    If there are no other issues holding us back, updating from Qt 5.6 to 5.10 may solve a lot of problems we are encountering. PySide2 seems to be at least working on an implementation for Qt 5.10, though I am not sure if that is in production, yet.
    
    Gunther


From Kathleen:
Looks like on the dev version of pyside2 they are working on support qt
5.11 so I think we should be good to uprade qt to 5.10.

Still no official releases, though.

Dear All,

just a short question about missing library dependencies in building
VisIt2.13.0 using the build_visit2_13_0.txt-script (downloaded 31st of
January 2018):

Initially, the installation of VisIt 2.13.0 on my linux machine was
successful: ('All indications are that VisIt successfully built').

However on starting the executable (visit2.13.0/src/bin/visit) I got the
following massages:

Running: gui-dv
Running: viewer ...
error while loading shared libraries: libvtkjsoncpp-6.1.so.1 ...cannot open shared object..

after which the execution halted.

Checking with ldd on the library dependencies of the files (eg. viewer,
but also others) it turns out that
about five vtk-related libraries are not linked (see attached output of
ldd - some of the other vtk-libraries are linked, however), although they
are present in the vtk-directories created by the build_visit2_13_0.txt-script.

Checking on the web it appears that this issue was also observed for
the parallel version of VisIt.

Since the built-script is quite impressive - do you have any
suggestion where to add these missing library dependencies into the
build_visit2_13_0.txt script?

Built-Log-file (build_visit2_13_0.txt_log.gz) and the output of ldd is
attached (visit_libraries.txt).

The machine is a standard desktop PC (Intel CPU, OS: opensuse 42.3,
Linux kernel 4.4.103-36).

If you need further information, please let me know.

Any help is appreciated
Udo v. Toussaint

Hi.

To cut down on dead space, I've moved the legend inside the main frame
of my 2D Pseudocolor plot (I'm not blocking out any interesting data).

Since no single font color makes the numerical labels of the legend
stand out against the changing-color background, I'd like to use a

But the BB I get from Annotation -> Objects -> Legend -> Appearance ->

whole pseudocolor color strip, but it cuts off the top and bottom

The problem goes away if I enable ""Draw title"" and ""Draw min/max"", but
I don't want either of those in my plot.

Does anyone know how to increase the size of the BB?
