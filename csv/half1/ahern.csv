436,Developer Review,VisIt,Feature,Normal,User friendly host profiles (part 1),"","","",Sean Ahern,10/20/2010,"",0,"",10/20/2010 12:24 pm,11/03/2010 01:26 pm,"","","",3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"The host profiles that we distribute with VisIt should have placeholders where more user information is required.  An example is the bank. Some profiles require that users enter a bank before they can submit jobs. Rather than prompt users for a possible bank at install time, this should be done at run time.  A placeholder of some type should be in the initial host profile for the bank.  At runtime, and the first time a profile with a placeholder is used, VisIt should prompt the user for the value of that field.  This could pertain to any item in the profile, not just bank.  The entered value would then be stored back in the profile, memorized for future use.

This would allow us to no longer prompt for the bank at install time (confusing users), and would allow prompting for other information. It would allow multiple host profiles with placeholders to be installed at once."

Ideally, users should be able to open a host profile through the normal File Open dialog.  VisIt should then detect that it's a host profile file an import it appropriately.  (This has the potential to cross a network boundary between the mdserver and the viewer.)"
