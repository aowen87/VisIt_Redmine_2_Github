Use hardware off-screen rendering on Mac and Windows.
Use a non-mangled mesa on Unix and then at start up choose between mesa and OpenGL for the engine.

Then we can rip out the mangled mesa support and the GLEW support, which should simplify things a bit.

Hi Eric,

I had a user come into my office wanting to transform a set of points in 3D to 2D.  I brought up the ""Project"" operator and the drop down box showed the following notation:

Z-Axis Cartesian (x <= x, y <= y)
...

At first we interpreted '<=' as less than or equal and didn't understand it as mapping.  We eventually figured that out, but then became confused by how this notation was used in the cylindrical projections.  

We discussed it and recommend / request, that the projections be described explicitly by the equations used in the projections, with primed values representing the newly projected coordinates.  For example, projecting XYZ to XY along the Z axis would have the following descriptor:

Z-Axis Cartesian (x' = x, y' = y)

This way a common mathematical notation is used, and it is quite explicit and self describing about what the projection operator will do."

This is highly inconvenient and also breaks reading back VTK files that have been exported that contain multiple blocks, since the blocks are grouped with a "".visit"" file. A fix to that problem would be to export them to the appropriate parallel VTK file (although they don't allow mixing mesh types). The more general problem could be fixed in one of two ways.

1) Create an STSD reader for the single block vtk files and an STMD reader for multi block files.

2) Fix the problem of grouping STSD files. The relevant code is in SetupDatabase, which is in each of the STMD readers. Here is the one in the VTK reader:

Here is his e-mail reporting the bug and providing a fix.

hi there

I have a large binary tecplot file, a single 3D block with x,y,z coordinates which do not have ""standard"" names, and which I set explicitly via the ""set default open options"". The problem is that the 3rd dimension is completely ignored and File Information always reports that the file has spatial dimension = 2.

Debugging it points me to a single line which seems to be the culprit, since it returns the empty string for the call CoordinateVariable(2).

TecplotFile::CoordinateVariable(int axis) const { // stuff deleted return (axis < 2) ? vars[axis] : std::string(); }

I have modified this to be:

return (axis <= 2) ? vars[axis] : std::string();

and I can now successfully read the file as a 3D grid. I have looked at the tests and none seems to exercise the FileOpenOptions via a SetDefaultFileOpenOptions(""Tecplot"", opts), so it is possible this feature was undetected.

have others seen issues with that?

P.S. The file reads perfectly well with the tecplot application and with another open-source code.

to be smarter. Perhaps it could take the entire output of the date command and strip out any spaces (and possibly any other problematic characters)"

Here is information about reproducing them:

The data files to reproduce the bug are:

if7f_001.00020
if7f_004.00020

Bug 1:

Step to demonstrate bug:

1) Have ""Apply subset selections to all plots"" on (the default).
2) Open if7f_004.00020
3) Add a Pseudocolor of hist/incmat1_1/dmfdt/temp
4) Add a Pseudocolor of hist/incmat2_2/dmfdt/temp
5) Press Draw

The second plot will generate the message:

WARNING: The Pseudocolor plot of variable ""hist/incmat2_2/dmfdt/temp"" yielded
no data.

This is because VisIt used the SIL selection from plot 1 of

incmat1_1 on
incmat2_2 off
incmat3_3 off

for plot 2, when the second variable is defined on incmat2_2. The work around is to turn off ""Apply subset selections to all plots"" and set the SIL for the second plot to be

incmat1_1 off
incmat2_2 on
incmat3_3 off

Bug 2:

1) Have ""Apply subset selections to all plots"" on (the default).
2) Open if7f_004.00020
3) Add a Filled Boundary plot of material.
4) Add a Pseudocolor of hist/incmat1_1/dmfdt/temp
5) Press Draw

This gives a plot where the Pseudocolor plot is drawing extra partial zones. This is because it selects all the materials for the Pseudocolor plot when the variable is only defined on incmat1_1. You may need to hide the Filled Boundary plot to see the problem."

Hi Jeremy,

I added the following flags in script build_visit2_3_0 near line 3305:

    qt_flags=""${qt_flags} -nomake docs""
    qt_flags=""${qt_flags} -nomake examples""
    qt_flags=""${qt_flags} -nomake demos""
    qt_flags=""${qt_flags} -opensource""
    qt_flags=""${qt_flags} -confirm-license""

A first test worked fine for me.
It speeds up the compilation a bit and
license confirmation is not necessary any more.

Actually I wanted to get aroung the Qt-Bug, but setting ""-nomake tools"" is not possible, because it affects the compilation of uic :(

Hi,

ok .. this looks like nitpicking :) but it might help other newbies and one only recognizes this the first time compiling a new software (afterwards you simply know what to do).

another minor addition for ""build_visit2_3_0"":

    info ""This will produce a tarball called visitVERSION . ARCH . tar . gz, where""
    info ""VERSION is the version number, and ARCH is the OS architecure.""
    info
    info ""To install the above tarball in a directory called ""INSTALL_DIR_PATH"",""
    info ""enter: svn_bin/visit-install VERSION ARCH INSTALL_DIR_PATH""

This looks like using visit-install has to be called this way:
  svn_bin/visit-install 2_3_0 linux-x86_64 /home/itv/bin/visit because ""make package"" creates a file with the name ""visit2_3_0 . linux-x86_64 . tar . gz""
But visit-install has to be called like this:
  svn_bin/visit-install 2.3.0 linux-x86_64 /home/itv/bin/visit or you will get errors after 50% of the installation process starting with this:
./svn_bin/visit-install: line 606: cd:
distribution/visit2_3_0.linux-x86_64/2_3_0: No such file or directory

Thanks for that great software.
I am really happy with it and looking forward to combine VisIt with our DNS code!

Below is an e-mail describing it with a solution.

Hello,

I've been trying to install Visit on my macbook pro core duo (32bits)
/ mac OS 10.6.6, using the visit-install script, as written in the
readme file.

I do this :

./visit-install 2.2.1 darwin-i386 ~/visit

the script prints some stuff in the terminal and finishes with this :

667495 blocks
64426 blocks
find: /Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin//Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin/gui.app/Contents/MacOS:

No such file or directory
find: /Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin//Users/nicolasaunai/visit/2.2.1+/darwin-i386/bin/xmledit.app/Contents/MacOS:
No such file or directory
visit-install done



The version I've downloaded is :
https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/2.2.1/VisIt-2.2.1-i386-installer.dmg



I think the error comes from the following part of the visit-install code :

if [ ""$os"" = ""darwin"" ]; then
    for arch in `ls ""$dir""/$version+`; do
        if [ ""$arch"" != ""bin"" ]; then
            for app in `find ""$dir""/$version+/$arch/bin -name ""*.app""
-print`; do
                find ""$dir""/$version+/$arch/bin/$app/Contents/MacOS
-exec chmod $dir_permission {} \;
            done
        fi
    done
fi



the $app variable is already a complete absolute path, not the name of
the .app file as the find command seems to be written for...


The error disappears if the previous lines are replaced by the following :


if [ ""$os"" = ""darwin"" ]; then
    for arch in `ls ""$dir""/$version`; do
        if [ ""$arch"" != ""bin"" ]; then
            for app in `find ""$dir""/$version/$arch/bin -name ""*.app"" -print`; do
                find $app/Contents/MacOS -exec chmod $dir_permission {} \;
            done
        fi
    done
fi




Unfortunatly, even with this correction, I can't make visit work :

If I click on the 'gui.app' in the finder in
visit_directory/2.2.1/darwin-i386/bin/gui.app

the application is launch but seems not responding before starting...
(blocked at the initialization window at the begining of the progress
bar)

if I run the 'visit' script in the terminal :

[~/visit/bin]$ ./visit
Version 2.2.1 of 'gui' does not exist for
the architecture 'darwin-x86_64'.
VisIt located binaries for the following architectures:
        darwin-i386




What should I do ?


Thanks

More problems with the in-situ examples when compiling with PARALLEL=ON

not a big deal for me, as long as you guys certify that there will be a new release before Hank and I teach the next tutorial (if accepted) in Germany in June.

in sim[234]p.c, the include statement 

#include ""SimulationExample.h""

needs to be moved after the
#ifdef PARALLEL
#include <mpi.h>

I have checked the trunk, and strangely, this was not caught by Brad or myself.

Hi,

Thanks. Actually, I had some problems with the MOAB/FMDB that ships with VisIt. It was due to stricter checking of header files by gcc-4.4.3. Particularly for MOAB: I had to add header  #include <stdio.h> to the following files:

/ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/WriteHDF5.cpp
/ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/tools/convert.cpp - /ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/tools/skin.cpp
/ITAPS-MOAB-3.99-20Apr09/tools/iMesh/ 

It looked like FMDB has similar problems.

I spoke with Mark about this and he will patch the later versions of the libraries with
fixes to resolve this problem. build_visit will be updated to use the new libraries."

When it does that it saves a session file and gives you the command to run. One of the things that it saves in the session file is the launch parameters for launching the engine the same way you were when you went to save the movie. For example, if you were running in parallel with 4 processors it should run with 4 processors when you later create the movie. Instead it just runs a serial engine.

To reproduce this problem I did the following:

1) Open wave.silo.
2) When the engine launching window comes up, run with 4 processors.
3) Create a pseudocolor plot of pressure.
4) Bring up the movie wizard, have it create a movie of png images.
5) In the very last window, have it give you the command to run to save the movie and save the command.
6) Exit VisIt.
7) Execute the command given in step 5.

You will see that it starts a serial engine.

Here is the output I got, which clearly shows I ran it in parallel and then when I created the movie it ran a serial engine.

Hi Eric, Brad and Cyrus,

Do you recall each of you helping me with the very long hangs I was experiencing when I tried starting up VisIt?  We tried a bunch of things, none of which worked.  I think I’ve found the problem, at least a likely cause of the problem, which may suggest a path to fixing it.  

All of my work is with very large parallel computing, which typically generates tens of thousands of files in any given directory.  When I launch VisIt in those directories with all those files, VisIt hangs for a long time (typically minutes, not seconds).  When I launch in a parent directory with few files, it starts up like a charm.  I note that the operating system on the LC machines hangs for minutes at a time when I do simple unix commands like “ls”, etc in those file-heavy directories.  It simply can’t go through all those file quickly.   I suspect that during start-up VisIt is using some unix command that the system can’t process in any reasonable time.  

Given that VisIt is a great tool for parallel post-processing, it seems like a major bug that it can’t start up in a reasonable amount of time in precisely those directories where a massive number of files exist from large parallel runs.

Just a thought.

Best,
Greg

Here is a follow on e-mail:

What about adding an initial backslash character before the unix command (like: “\ls”) in your VisIt start-up routines?  I do this when I want a listing of the directory files without the long hangs for the regular ls command to complete.

Subject: [visit-users] Time Curve of mesh variables

Hello all,

I have a dataset with multiple time steps and an unstructured mesh plus 
two scalar variables, say X and Y. Both X and Y are constant over the 
full domain.

What I would like to get is a single X-Y curve over all time steps.
I actually achieved nearly that by creating query-over-time plots after 
picking a random point for both X and Y, then exporting the resulting 
curves as 'curve' data, opening that file and finally doing a scatter

I told him that he could then parse the 2 curve files to generate a new
curve file with X vs Y.

The whole process could be made easier and the last step could be made
easier. Is there some new paradigm that would make this entire class of
problem simpler?"

  Hi All.

Michael, Brad, thank you for your comments.

However, it will be interesting to hear which data formats could provide information about block connectivity (ghost zones) to VisIt for multiblock grids?

Silo, VTK, what else?

I think it would actually be a good idea if we documented what features are supported in what readers. We could probably have a table that lists key features and then links to more information about restrictions, etc. We don't need to do this for every reader. If it isn't know, we could just put that in. I believe it would reduce support e-mails."

After a string of e-mail messages I finally got the file from hit and found that is was a tiff image with all the alpha values zero. So the image was transparent. It would be nice if this was detected and handled automatically. It could either be done in the image reader or in the truecolor plot. I think the true color plot would be slightly better. I guess there could also be an explicit toggle on the truecolor plot to ignore alpha values. The work around is to create a new variable that is ""color(red,green,blue)""."

Actually, that link has what I would call ""generalities"" about svn scripts and development process, mixed with philosophy, theory and other stuff.  I've seen that link before and found it mostly a good place to go to get confused.
What would be really useful on the wiki would be a straightforward tutorial on how to actually get work done as a new developer!  :-)

Here are my notes.  Note that it is a ""how to"" and not a ""how it all works in theory"" document:

2010-11-30
For a complicated description of this, go to http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Collab:VisItWiki_SVNScripts

The proper way to do this is to check out the current RC branch, e.g.
svn co svn+ssh://cook47@svn.nersc.gov/svn/visit/branches/2.2RC/src/databases/paraDIS
cd paraDIS

To be more complete, you could do this:
svn co svn+ssh://cook47@svn.nersc.gov/svn/visit/branches/2.2RC/src/svn_bin
./svn_bin/co_rctrunk 2.2RC sdt

I'm not sure what ""sdt"" does, but I think it gets src, databases and test subdirectories.

You are now working on the next release of 2.2.  If 2.2.1 is the current release, you are working on 2.2.2 or something.  Your changes will be in the next release BUT THEY WILL NOT BE ON THE TRUNK, so version 2.3 will NOT include your changes unless you do a ""merge"" into the trunk!

When you have gotten your code in order and are ready to merge them to the trunk, you have to first check out the trunk using the special script (which you can download from svn)

src/svn_bin/co_trunk all

Now merge your new commits on 2.2RC to the trunk:
cd trunk
src/svn_bin/merge_rctrunk_to_trunk 2.2RC

You must run merge_rctrunk_to_trunk at the trunk directory.  I.e. ""ls"" should show the ""src"" directory. Assuming you're there and it's still not working, then make sure there are ""trunk/.rootpath"" and ""trunk/.branchname"" files.  If not, then it is because you didn't check out using src/svn_bin/co_trunk.  You can fix it, though.
cd trunk
echo trunk > .branchname
echo '/' > .rootpath"

Hello,

After some fiddling I managed to successfully build VTK. For reference, let me list what I had to do:
 - in VTK/Rendering/vtkGraphicsFactory.cxx I had to uncomment the #if defined (VTK_USE_X) that surrounds  #include ""vtkXMesaRenderWindow.h""
 - in VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx I had to add #include ""glx.h""
 - then I run make CPATH=$PWD/MangleMesaInclude LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VISIT_PATH/python/2.6.4/linux-x86_64_gcc-4.5/lib
 (the latter was needed because the python-runtime library was not found during the generation of Python-wrappers - I'm trying to build using:
 ./build_visit2.3.0 --console --python-module --silo)

It is extremely important NOT to try to restart the build-process using the build-script, since that will run CMake, which will overwrite the changes just made. So run make && make install in the VTK soure-dir.

Now the build of VisIt itself aborted.... let's see what's happening there.

Greetings, Jakob

I frequently wish to save a 2D image to disk from VisIt, with no border and perfect aspect ratio.  In order to do so, I have to do the following dance: 
1)  turn off all annotations
1b) #1 should take care of this, but I find I also have to go into 2D and turn off ""show axes.""  Is this a bug?  
2)  Set the window 2D viewport to 0 1 0 1
3)  Set the 2D View Window to fit the data extents exactly
4)  Go to the Set Save Options, click ""No resolution constraint"" and set the resolution to a nice multiple of the aspect ratio
5)  pick a name and click Save. 

I wonder, am I the only one doing this?  I would like see this added as a feature somehow, not sure what to call it, maybe ""Save data as texture,"" get prompted for size, image type and name, and the rest gets done for me.  

Can I create a macro to do this?"

A reasonable solution would be to find all the points within a user specifiable distance from the line and then project those points to the line and then use that to generate the line out. This could in theory work with zonal and nodal data. With nodal data it would take the nodes within the distance of the line and with zones it would take the zone centers within the distance from the line.

The GUI does not tell me which plot this is and I have several plots.  Is there a way for VisIt to tell me which plot is problematic by naming it?  I figured it out by fiddling with plots to make them come on and off, but this seems like a deficiency in the GUI.  Plot 0 was not the first plot in the list, by the way, so it really is a guessing game sometimes.
