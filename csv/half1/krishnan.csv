1470,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,High,All VTK_DEFINITIONS parameters are not getting passed at compile time leading to VisIt crashes at runtime,Kathleen Biagas,"",2.8,Harinarayan Krishnan,05/22/2013,"",0,"",05/22/2013 02:19 pm,04/08/2014 11:23 am,3 - Occasional,5 - Very Serious,2.6.2,"","",All,Any,"Hi all,

Functions such as ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS() are getting called with parameters such as the one below

ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS(time_annotation ${VTK_DEFINITIONS}) 

where VTK_DEFINITIONS contains a list of compile time definitions (-D flags).

Unfortunately, it seems that by the time the function body of ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS executes only the first definition makes it to the body.

The definitions inside VTK_DEFINITIONS contain register overrides for VTK to dynamically load the appropriate subclasses. For example vtkRenderer is overridden to load vtkOpenGLRenderer. 

Without these definition overrides the default vtkRenderer::New() operation returns NULL. This had the side affect of causing the VisIt viewer to crash when support for modules like R are added to VTK. 

Needless to say this is really bad, and extremely difficult to diagnose.

Currently, I resolved this issue by passing ${VTK_DEFINITIONS} in quotes ""${VTK_DEFINITIONS}"", but I think we might need to find a better solution.

Also, it seems like we may need to ensure other functions or macros are not having similar truncation problems.

New version streamlined the process and removed other helper functions (generatorrunner,apiextractor)

Changes needed in CMake/FindPySide.cmake and bv_pyside.sh

Possible issues:
Previous PySide soft linked to Python Installed and this should be moved to lib/site-packages/ and potentially remove the soft link of previous installations.

Ideas: Update internallauncher to not set PYTHONHOME just for cli.
Update PYTHONPATH to add VisIt's site-package directory even for System or Alternate installations.

Also, add PIP support and add simple python -c ""import <checks>"" to see if installation support VisIt requirements (numpy, rpy2, etc...) .
