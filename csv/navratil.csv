This happens on a trivial dataset for my builds of 2.4.0 on both TACC lonestar and longhorn systems.  I create a contour plot with three value surfaces and set the outer two to 25% opacity (the third is at 100%) and in the plot, all three contours are at 100% opacity.

Pictures attached of 2.4.0 behavior and 2.3.0 (correct) behavior"
