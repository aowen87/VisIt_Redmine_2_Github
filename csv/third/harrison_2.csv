This was the original problem repoted by Jose.

<pre>
Jose Milovich was running client server and he wanted to export a database in VTK format.
He couldn't find the file after he saved it. It turned out when you select the directory
to store the file, it shows you the file system on the local machine and not the
remote machine (not surprisingly). He choose a directory that existed on the local
machine, but not on the remote machine so the file did not get saved. We should
either show the directory system on the remote machine or make it clear that it will
end up on the remote machine and not let the user browse the file system to select
the directory. Jose also thought that the default should be the same directory where
the data was located, not the users home directory on the remote machine.
</pre>

It turns out fixing this in general can be quite difficult involving reasoning backwards from the plot to be exported, which engine the plot is associated with, then the host that engine is running on, then bringing up a file browser remotely connected to that filesystem, etc.

But, something simple we can do is to prevent attempts to browse the filesystem when in client/server mode by graying out (disabling) the browse button. This will prevent users from being lulled into incorrectly thinking they are browsing the remote (engine) filesystem.

Part 1
======
1. Open dbA00.pdb from the test case data
2. Create an expression: diff = <mesh/ireg> - conn_cmfe(</path/to/dbA00.pdb[-1]id:mesh/ireg>, mesh)
   Be sure to put the right path to dbA00.pdb in the expression
3. Create a Pseudocolor plot of diff and click Draw

VisIt will issue an error: ""The databases cannot be compared because they have a different number of domains""

This is just not true and the expression works as it should in VisIt 1.11.0. Maybe VisIt 2.0z is choking on this file because it has multiple meshes.

I ran into this because I was testing some other CMFE stuff because Jose Milovich was having problems and I decided to start with the time difference expressions that I had created in the User Manual.

Part 2
======
When I tried using the ""time_derivative"" expressions in the plot menu instead of my expression, I got a different error: ""An invalid variable (time_derivative) was specified."""

http://visitusers.org/forum/YaBB.pl?num=1322486424/

Example files from Chris:

#--- Example file 1:
import sys

_visit_path = ...some path...
sys.path.insert(0, _visit_path)
from visit import *

if Launch() == 0:
   print ""Launch failed.""
   sys.exit()
else:
   print ""Launched VisIt, version %s"" % Version()

Close()

#--- Example file 2
import sys

_visit_path = ...some path...
sys.path.insert(0, _visit_path)
from visit import *

def main(argv=None):

   if argv is None:
       argv=sys.argv[1:]

   if Launch() == 0:
       print ""Launch failed.""
       sys.exit()

   print dir()
   print ""Version"" in dir() # This prints true, so why does the following call fail?

   print ""Launched VisIt, version %s"" % Version()

   Close()

if __name__==""__main__"":
   sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))

#--- Example 3
import sys

_visit_path = ...some path...
sys.path.insert(0, _visit_path)
from visit import *

if Launch() == 0:
   print ""Launch failed.""
   sys.exit()
else:
   print ""Launched VisIt, version %s"" % Version()

def main(argv=None):

   if argv is None:
       argv=sys.argv[1:]

   print ""Version"" in dir() # This prints False, but the following call is ok.

   print Version()

   return 0

if __name__==""__main__"":
   sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))

First example works fine.

In the second example, the code '""Version"" in dir()', following the call to Launch, prints True, which indicates that the call to visit.Launch was successful and all the functions from the VisIt API are loaded (print dir() lists all the functions I expect from the VisIt API). However the call to Version() fails, with the error ""NameError: global name 'Version' is not defined"". The first example runs fine and prints the correct version number.

Third example: I have noticed that if I modify example 1 above to include a main function (like in example 2) calling dir() within this main function does not list any of the VisIt API functions. However, all the functions are available to me. Not sure if this clarifies the issue or not.

Chris got around the issue using the following code after a launch:

# Loop through the local namespace and add the names that were just imported to the module namespace
loc = locals()
for key in loc:
    setattr(sys.modules[__name__], key, loc[key])

We should try to correct these cases.

Gary's code recently changed the gmap data structured written to Silo to include info about if a neighbor relationship is a periodic boundary condition.

Currently these boundaries are ghosted out by VisIt since we treat them as regular interior boundaries.

For now, we should enhance the reader to ignore these neighbors so the mesh can be displayed.

In the future, it would be nice to have a feature that allows us to still do ghost zone communication across these boundaries, but still treat them as external surfaces.

----
I have a 3D mesh, which I am taking a slice of and later getting the spatial extents (I only want information along 1 axis). 

Since I’ve already taken the slice, I’d like to get the actual extents, not the original ones. 

If you record taking the spatial extents with original data, it records the following: Query(""SpatialExtents"", 0, 0, ""default"")
If you record taking the spatial extents with actual data, it records the following: Query(“SpatialExtents”, 1, 0, “default”)


However, pasting the command “Query(“SpatialExtents”, 1, 0, “default”)” into the command line will give you spatial extents for the original data.  The correct command for the actual data is Query(“SpatialExtents”,1,”default”).  This happens on other commands, too, not only Spatial Extents.

 

Thanks,

Sarah

----

I believe SpatialExtents is only one example of where we get the ""original vs actual"" recording incorrect.

I was thinking this as well, but if you're submitting a ticket, I have one suggestion:

I'd like it to have both ~/.visit/<arch>/<version>  (the new spot) AND retain ~/.visit/<arch>/  (the old spot), so that it's still usable for development or beta work as well as for released versions. 

I do agree it's a simple change to internallauncher.  If I find time before anyone else gets around to it, I might even try to add it.  Thanks!

The e-mail chain for the request:

John,
    The short answer is there is no way to install different private plugins for more than one version of VisIt. We've run into this problem in the past as well. I think adding this capability would be fairly easy. It might even be as simple as including a version number into the $visitprivateplugins variable's path inside the internallauncher script. That is where the VISITPLUGINDIR environment variable that VisIt uses to obtain its plugin directories gets set up.

Jean's email:
-----
Hello all

I am having a problem with the search path for a user-defined db plugin. (I use tag 14869)

1) when running ""by hand""

visit -np N -norun engine_par
+ 
mpiexec -n N /etc/etc  -plugindir 

everything is working well. The plugin is found since the -plugindir option correctly lists all possible locations

2), when running with

visit -nowin -cli -s test.py

I get the error:

viewer: The pipeline object is being used improperly: The DB factory was told to open a file of type MemCom_1.0, but the engine had no plugin of that type.

so the mdserver sees my plugin and does it job, while the other processes do not see my plugin.

It appears that my plugins are compiled and installed in $HOME/.visit/2.3.0/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases whereas they used to be installed in $HOME/.visit/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases

my env variable is set to:

VISITPLUGINDIR=/users/jfavre/.visit/2.3.0/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases:/users/jfavre/.visit/linux-x86_64/plugins:/apps/eiger/VisIt/2.3.0/2.3.0/linux-x86_64/plugins

my python line is:

db = OpenDatabase(""eiger:/project/csvis/jfavre/Vos/TransonicCruiser.db/data.1"", 0, ""MemCom_1.0"")

The only way I seem to resolve this is by manually copying the lib files from $HOME/.visit/2.3.0/linux-x86_64/plugins/databases to $HOME/users/jfavre/.visit/linux-x86_64/plugins

Is this intended, or do I have something out-of-sync?

Nonetheless, if I put up a PC plot of a mq expression, the Variables widget is not activated to allow me to easily change from amoung the mq variables.

We rated large task cost here because we assumed that is why the issues outlined here are/were not addressed when these new functions were introduced...

1) While visit-experts might understand when and why to use a 'cell_constant' or 'point_constant' expression, ordinariy users most likely will not. I am pretty sure they would neither think to look for these expressions or, even after stumbling into them, would really know when/why to use them. This is a pitch for saying that these expressions should happen 'automatically' whenever a user uses a constant in an expression and should NOT require the user to do something special to get constant behavior.

2) The names 'cell' and 'point' probably mean a lot more to a visit-developer than to a user who is most likely going to think 'zone' and 'node' which is also the same terminology the rest of VisIt's GUI uses. So, it probably makes sense to rename these.

3) We also need constants for vectors, maybe colors and tensors too.

Why is the option of plotting 'points' on a curve plot an either/or option? It looks like curve plot can be plotted using 'lines' or using 'points.' I'd like to make a plot using lines but with little triangle symbols at every 10th point. I don't think this is possible with current interface. I think the two options are orthogonal and should be independently controlled. One option is whether to connect the 'space' between points with lines. The other option is whether to draw the points with special symbol. One should be able to do either/or and both of these."

Also, what does symbol 'density' mean? it looks like its an 'int' valued field that can be only greater than zero. Does a value of K there mean to plot every Kth point? Also, while the GUI would allow me to manually type in a larger number, I could not also decrease the value by typing manually. I can use only the inc/dec arrows to actaully decrease this value. So, when I typed 1000 in to see what happened, I then had to set there and hold the dec arrow down for 5 minutes to get it to decriment back down to a 'normal' value.

The range for this spin box is 10 <-> 1000.
The previous (pre Qt4) behavior was if you typed in a number below 10, you would end up with 10. Now you just get last successful number. So I believe Mark  was trying to type a number less than 10 to lower the value from 1000 and thought the spin box was broken.

The meaning of ""density"" isn't very obvious and the arbitrary minimum of 10 is the source of the confusion.

Multi-level AMR problems allow you to do a subset plot of 'levels', however if a dataset evolves to have a single level (for example if the grid is completely refined & all lower levels are dropped) this breaks the subset plot.

=========================
>From Preeti's email:


I am using the NETCDF output files from WRF(Weather Research and
Forecast Model). The basic reader is not being used for this. The
basic NETCDF reader could not display all variables properly so I had
coded a NETCDF reader for WRF. It can recognize all variables and time
dimension as well.

I have seen the code for the same in BasicNETCDFFileFormat.C in VisIt
v1.11.1 and v1.12.0. I have tried to read the WRF output NETCDF file
using this basic reader, it recognizes the file but the domain
decomposition does not occur. I would like to elaborate my findings
regarding this,

In databases/NETCDF/avtBasicNETCDFFileFormat.C,
line #272 -- PopulateDatabaseMetaData -- This function has a call to
ReturnValidDimensions like below

Line 411
                    bool valid = ReturnValidDimensions(meshDims,
                         validDims, nValidDims);


Since this is called using 3 arguments, the rest two are 0 (as
declared in header file)
As a result in function 'ReturnValidDimensions' in Line #518, the if
statement ""if (!(dimStarts && dimCounts))"" is always true, thus the
function returns without proceeding to the domain decomposition code
ie the function 'ComputeRectilinearDecomposition' at Line #562 is
never called, Hence no domain decomposition occurs.

I have verified this from the log files also.
Please let me know if I made some mistake in understanding."

The SAMRAI folks are beginning work on their own MIR algorithms which
they will be using within their code. They'll need to debug it and
would like to visualize the MIR as they computed it, not as VisIt
would.

There are multiple approache here. Some involve exchange of code that
computes the MIR. Another approach is to allow for the pre-computed
MIR to be stored to the database. This might be possible without
modifying Silo. Here is the basic idea.

The original mesh is simply a zoo of elements (for QuadMesh's its a
zoo of size 1). The pre-computed MIR has the effect of NOT changing
any elements that are clean and introducing a tiny zoo of elements on
any elements that are mixing. In theory, a data-producer could make a
UCD mesh (or several of them) consiting of the union of all the new
elements introduced by MIR. It would be a funny mesh in that it would
be approx 1 original-mesh-zone thick and wind around the 3D volume
following the MIR boundaries. But it would nonetheless be an object
Silo currently supports. The only additional bit of information that
might be useful is to define a UCDVar on the MIR mesh that identified
the original-mesh-zone id from which the newly introduced zones come
from.

Given this information in the file, VisIt would then offer an option
of either computing its own MIR or using the one thats there."

A user spent a lot of time (several hours) getting a series of queries over time into a VisIt window. He had several curves there generated throughout the morning.

Then, he accidentally tried to add a PC plot of a mesh variable to the window with the curves in it. That operation threw an exception (plot dimensions don't match or something like that) and then promptly invalidated all his time curves. They were gone for good.

First, we probably should not be invalidating existing plots because a new plot was not valid. Second, what can we do to protect users against this loss of information, particular long operations such as queries over time?

This user has since taken to exporting dbs after he generates his time curves.

>From Jeremy Meredith:

When generating an attribute subject from an XML file, it looks there
are a couple problems with the code generated for fields when using
access settings other than ""private"".  I believe you can expose this by
making an XML file with a single float field, setting its access to
either ""protected"" or ""public"", and trying to compile.

 

For ""protected"", I would still expect the Set/Get methods to get
generated, because there's no other way for external clients of the
class to set/get their valuyes.  (In fact, should protected be the
default instead of private?  I tend to use protected members more often
than private in general.)

 

As for ""public"", I'm not sure how to Select() the field for notification
without using Set/Get, but I suppose that's up to the client.  (That's
the downside of public members to begin with, so maybe that's not a
concern.)

 

But whether or not the Set/Get functions are generated, it looks like
the SetFromNode function is still calling the Set method, which leads to
a compilation error.  (CreateNode does not seem to use the Get method,
however.)  At the very least, for public members (and maybe protected if
we decide they shouldn't have Get/Set functions) members, SetFromNode
shouldn't use the Set function."

cq-submit-date: 04/15/08

I listed this as a bug but one could argue that it is really an enhancement request.

The user reported that after re-center a mass quantity from its native zone-centered state to a node-centered state, mass was created. As we spoke, it made perfect sense to me given what recentering in VisIt is doing. When we re-center in VisIt from zones to nodes, we...

   a) visit each node
   b) find all zones that share the node
   c) add up the zonal values for those zones
   d) divide (average) by the number of zones

However, the user explained that for the mass quantity he was
dealing with, the right algorithm is...

   a) visit each zone
   b) divide the zonal value by the number of nodes the zone has
   c) accumulate the value to each of the zone's nodes

This is fundamentally the difference between an intrinsic and extrinsic quantity. An intrinsic quantity is one that DOES NOT change as you cut a zone into smaller pieces. Temperature is an example. If you cut a zone of temperature T0 into two pieces, each piece will have temperature T0. However, if you cut a zone of mass M1 into pieces, each piece will have a mass different from M1 (usually related to volume differences assuming a constant density)

VisIt needs to know the 'intrinsic'/'extrinsic' nature of its variables. That is a new flag on all avtXXXMetaData objects which can have the values; Extrinsic, Intrinsic, Unspecified. In the case that a variable's intrinsic-ness is Unspecified, the user needs the ability to specify which recentering algorithm above to use. So, re-center in PC plot and recenter expression need an option for this.

A separate ticket is for Silo to include extrnisic/intrinsic options in its variables."

Changing the 'number format' for a contour plot's legend has
no effect on the tick-mark labels, only on min/max.

I noticed this while working on some changes to the legends.
I don't know if users would even want to change this ... but
I thought I'd document the problem.

Current implementation details:

Our vtk class for legends has the ability for tick mark labels
for 'levels' type legends to be supplied as strings or doubles.

Currently, no plot sends the values as double.  I would expect
Contour plot to be using the double-path, since its labels are 
the isovalues used in generating the plot.

However, the isovalues are generated by avtContourFilter, and
those double values are converted to strings using a hard-coded
number format. The strings are then sent as 'labels' attached
to the vtkDataSets in the pipeline. Contour plot retrieves
those string labels and sends them to the levels legend.

When the legend's number format is changed, the tick mark
labels are not affected, obviously, because they are strings,
not doubles."

VisIt contains logic to remove what it thinks are 'internal' edges from a mesh plot when it renders them.  It uses avtOriginalZoneNumbers to drive this logic. I think the logic is...

...given an edge, if all the zones that share that edge have the same 'avtOriginalZoneNumber', the edge is removed. However, this fails on edges that are in fact external to the whole plot as it removes them when it should not. So, if an edge is external to the whole plot, keep it regardless, otherwise, remove as per current algorithm.

This ticket is a big deal for Gunther and I.  But I don't have the guts to make the change without consulting the experts.  It appears to be a problem with 1.7.1 and with 1.9.0b.

Here is a reproducer with the current version of the code.  (We are making some changes that exacerbate this problem.)

1) Open /trunk/data/Chombo_plot_data/plot00000.2d.hdf5
2) Make a PC plot of U_vel
3) Bring up the subset window and turn off some levels
4) Draw
5) Delete the plot
6) Make a new PC plot of U_vel
7) Bring up the Subset window.  All of the levels are on.  This is not correct.  It should be the same as the SIL restriction from the first plot.

However, if you reverse steps 3 and 4, when you look at the subset window in step 7, some of the levels will be off (correctly).

Here's what I think is going wrong:
In step 4, the call to ViewerPlotList::UpdatePlots() enacts a call to clear the default SIL restrictions.  It only clears the default SIL restrictions for time varying data.  The default SIL restrictions live as a data member named ""SILRestrictions"" in the ViewerPlotList.

When you reverse steps 3 and 4, it means that the Draw causes the clear to happen before you set the SIL restriction.  Since you set the SIL restriction afterwards, it will become the new default and then everything will work correctly.

I'm happy to make the change here, but I feel a little gunshy, since this code is so central and there is a chance for unforeseen side effects.

Also, note that the bug is actually worse than what I'm describing above.  If you make a plot, draw, change the levels, apply the SIL change, delete the plot, and make a new plot, then everythings work fine (the new SIL is preserved).  But, if you then delete this new plot and another one, it goes back to turning all of the levels on.
(You have to do a SetSILRestriction after each DrawPlots to make it work correctly.)"

Marcel Zemp provided session files and relevant data files.
I copied his session files and modified them for our
machines and local directory.

I only investigated the plot using vel_rad as
the x-coordinate.

The gist is that the scatter plot is colored red when
restored from the sessionfile, but when created fresh
has lots of green, cyan and blue color.

All variables being used for the scatter plot are 
expressions, and the min/max for the Color variable
have been changed from default.

>From Marcel's email:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Hello,

I found a strange bug in Visit that has to do with scatter plot. If you 
open the attached session file then the colour of the points is not 
correct. If one then:

- goes to scatter plots attributes
- disables the min/max values for the color range
- apply button
- enables the min/max values for the color range again
- apply button

=> colours are correct => but min/max values are still 0

Added ESB 4/4/2008:
>From additional e-mails:

Addition: If the plot is in a state where it shows the correct colour with a black background and then tries to swap the background/foreground colours => all points are black (with white background) and I found no way so far to change that....

Ok - a further addition: if I change the sphape into spheres instead of points, change to white background, start the keyframe animation then the colours come back after a few frames and I can even switch now between different background colours and the colours of the points are correct. So there is some wired stuff going on here... but I hope this probably helps to hunt down the bug..."

As he switched between desktops, VisIt's window became iconified.

So, he started the movie wizard with VisIt's window in an iconified state and quickly marched through all the dialogs not paying any attention to the window size that it had chosen. The result was 100 frames of pnm images at 300x300 resolution (not the iconified size of the window but not the DE-icondified size of the window either) and a bogus params file that caused mpeg2encode to die; horizontal and vertical sizes were 0 and bitrate was zero."

We know about this issue and there could be another ticket for it but here is a new instance of the problem.

Chad Noble gave me a Silo file that takes forever to open. I timed VisIt and the Silo file itself takes 17-30 seconds to open. That's way slow and there are a lot of subdirectories, etc that make the file reading slow.

The real problem is that once the file is open, each plot menu takes about 30 seconds to construct due to the large number of variables. Essentially, we're waiting about 20(menus)*30(sec/menu) seconds. I gave up each time since it was too long to wait to open a file.

We need to rethink our menus. Where possible, we need to share like menus between plots. We also should consider a way of dynamically creating different levels of the menu on the fly so they get created as we scroll to them. These enhancements, if possible, should greatly speed up menu creation and make file opening more tolerable for these types of files. If menu changes are not possible, we might switch the plot menus to an alternate, more efficient widget above a certain number of variables.

It's worth noting that the existing code (albeit somewhat modified) is 10x faster on my Qt4 branch. That's a large improvement but we should also implement other speed improvements."

Hank Shay was trying to limit the extent of a query over time and ran into several problems.
He was looking at silo files and the time slider displayed cycle numbers so it had not read
the times from all the files. So here are his problems.

1) He tried to limit it by time and specified a time less than between 0 and 1 and the
GUI just set it to 0 after he hit Apply. I assume the GUI is code so as to only take
integers. It should take them for times.

2) He tried to limit it by cycle and set it to a reasonable cycle and then it said that it
was out of range. When he did the query it did the entire range.

I also played with query over time with wave and set the cycle range to be 10 to 50, which
worked, but the cycles displayed on the x axis went from 100 to 500. I don't know why this
was off by a factor of 10."

When we do lineouts of zone-centered quantities, it is possible to obtain to plots that contain other than perfectly flat (slope=0) or perfectly vertical (slope=inf) line segments. However, this seems inaccurate because the field being sampled is piecewise constant. A lineout of such a field should, in theory, never have any line segment with 0 < slope < inf.

Perhaps the problem is really when we go to display the lineout 'samples' we obtain. Because we always wind up drawing line segments between the points effectively linearly interpolating the 'samples.'

Wouldn't it be more accurate to, for zone-centered quantities, compute the intersections of the line with each zone (which will yield line segments) and then assign the zone's value to that segment?

MCM -- Added 28Jan08

>From an email from Kathleen...

We don't really 'march' along the ray -- we use an interval tree
(created using spatial extents of zones) to determine which zones
 'might' be intersected by the ray, (in the case of non rectilinear data, 
we then perform more intersection tests on the candidate zones)

Thus we have a list of zones that have been intersected by the
ray, along with their intersection points (used in calculating distance
along the ray).  The 'intersection point' is the point (usually along
a face) where the ray 'entered' the zone.  

A 1D rectilinear grid is then constructed, with the x-values being
the distance along the ray of each intersection point.  The zone-centered
value of that intersected zone then becomes the scalar assigned to
the corresponding x-value in the grid.  if the variable is node-centered,
then the value assigned to the grid is an average of all the
node-values for that zone (the entire zone, not the 'entry' face).

The 'zonal_var' is a stair case from 0.5 in zone 0
to 4.5 in zone 5. The 'nodal_var' is a ramp from 0
at nodes 0 & 6 to 5 at nodes 5 and 11.

All lineouts are from (0, 0.5, 0) to (5, 0.5, 0) using the
Lineout Query.

Curve 0: is a lineout of the zonal_var
Curve 1: is a lineout of the nodal_var
Curve 2: is a lineout of zonal_var with sampling on and 500 samples
Curve 3: is a lineout of nodal_var with sampling on and 500 samples

Note that curve 0 and curve 1 both fall right on top of each other.
They also both start at a value of 0.5. For nodal, this is off by
0.5. It should start at 0. For zonal, its ok. So, curve 1 is 
too high by 0.5 over its whole length but is otherwise ok.
Also (and I know we're not set up to do this right now), I'd argue
that curve 0 should be a stair case, not a ramp. But, that is
another issue with how VisIt is drawing lineout results.

Now, the sampling results, curves 2 and 3, are more interesting.
I would expect the sampling result for the zonal_var to be pretty
close to a stair case. But is is still coming out a ramp. This seems
really off as most samples should be falling within just a single
zone and then getting evaluated to whatever that zone's zonal_var
value is. I would expect roughly 100 samples in zone 0 at a value
of 0.5, follwed by 100 samples in zone 1 at a value of 1.5, etc.

the logic is

This poses two questions:
1) Is it a good idea to allow MPI-2 features, should this (guarded) MPI-2 call exist?
2) Is there a better guard for this case, can we directly check to see if MPI_Type_get_extent is defined?)"

I fixed a problem with how DBForceSingle() was being handled in
the Silo plugin. It was being called with argument of 1, turned
ON that is, ONLY when the state variable, dontForceSingle was
0. That means if you ever initially opened with default settings
(e.g. dontForceSingle was zero), then if you changed it later
to be OFF (e.g. dontForceSingle was non-zero), then it would
just NOT call DBForceSingle. Now, it calls DBForceSingle() always
and sets arg to !dontForceSingle. This is 'better' but reveals
a broader problem though. The force single state of Silo is a
setting that is global to the whole library. If two databases
are opened one with the setting the one way and one with the
setting the other, then the resultant behavior for BOTH databases
will be whichever the setting was for the LAST opened database.

What we need to do is have each Silo-based plugin (Vista, SAMI,
Silo) maintain a local copy of Silo's global state and re-enumerate
that to Silo just prior to doing any operations to read data in
order to get completely correct behavior."

To make sure mesh plot lines (as well as other entities) don't wind up sometimes falling behind polygons, we offset them towards the eyepoint just a bit. Well, if you plot globe.silo mesh and rotate around, you can definately generate cases where mesh lines disappear and/or oscillate visibility.

I am certain this is NOT related to Mesa 7.5 as I can re-produce in 1.11.2.

We need to revisit this logic again. Maybe globe.silo is just a bad case where most quads are non-planar

MCM -- Added 31Aug09
--------------------
I looked at the 'face_planarity' metric for globe.silo to see if there are a lot of hexahedra there with non-planar faces. There are NOT.  And, just from the way the sphere geometry is sampled, I actually do NOT think it is possible for there to be non-planar quads. 

So, the problem with mesh lines dissappearing is NOT due to non-planar faces."

When we read in and then later export a mesh with material data on it, the exported material data has been 'remapped' by VisIt such that it does NOT match what was input to VisIt. The reason this happens is that internally, VisIt remaps the array representing the (lets just focus on non-mixed -- clean -- case for simplicity) array representing the material id in each zone to a 0...Nmats-1 values. I think all that is necessary is to include in avtMaterialMetaData and then also in avtMaterial the mapping from VisIt's internal material numbers (0...Nmats-1) to the original numbers. A simple intVector should suffice. That way, a writer can re-map if it so chooses. Of course, it'd be better if the remapping was done in the writer base classes so that each individual writer doesn't need to deal with it.

MCM -- Added 31Aug09
--------------------
In Silo and NASTRAN, where materials are exported, there is logic for sort of two cases; one when material selection is ON. In that case, the mesh that gets exported is not necessarily the same as the mesh that gets input. This is definitely true for mixing materials. The other case is just to write out the avtMaterial object that exists internally in VisIt, regardless of selection."

This was reported by Marc Durant from txcorp, I verified this on my linux box. 

======
Hello-

I have two plots in a single window:
1. Pseudocolor - Isosurface(YeeMagField_0)
2. Pseudocolor - Isosurface(YeeMagField_1))

Plot 1 is a field and uses the default settings for Isosurface and Pseudocolor.
Plot 2 is a field that is rendered as 25% opaque, and otherwise uses default settings.

I can add these plots and draw them once without any issue.  However, if I then hit the ""draw"" button and then rotate the view, plot 2 disappears.  Happens every single time.

Steps to duplicate:
1. Run VisIt
2. Open crabcavpython3p_YeeMagField_1.h5
3. Add a pseudocolor plot of YeeMagField_0
4. Add a pseudocolor plot of YeeMagField_1
5. Add the isosurface operator (this step may not be necessary to reproduce the bug, but otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the problem)
6. Double-click on Pseudocolor for the YeeMagField_1 plot.
7. Set ""Opaque"" to 25%
8. Hit Apply & Dismiss
9. Hit draw
10. Hit draw again
11. Rotate the view - plot 2 will disappear.

Attached is a zip file containing my vlog files, the data file used to reproduce the error, an ""expected"" image, and an ""actual"" image."

If you apply the Inverse Ghost Zone operator and turn on both ghost and non-ghost and export the result of that, you get something more reasonable, but still wrong of course because the domains overlap 1 zone wide."

We have a re-open operation. Why? I think this is to handle the case where the contents of the file VisIt currently has open changes out from underneath VisIt. On Windows, this can never happen (well, almost never, read on) so why have the button there at all on Windows? On windows, you have to close the database before its contents can be changed. This may have to do with how VisIt opens files on windows. Since we are using the sec2/stdio interfaces (C library) for accessing files on windows, I think we get default behavior for file sharing semantics there and, you can't ever change a files contents while VisIt has it open on windows. If you attempt it, you get an error saying the file is in use by another application."

Perhaps the most important thing cloning a window does is to ensure it has all the same plots and operators. That works fine. And, I check a number of other attributes of windows such as scalable rendering mode, stereo mode, even lights. They all seem to track fine across cloning of windows; at least from window 0 to window 1. I did NOT testing cloning when say 3 or 4 windows are already up with different attributes settings.

At any rate, we do NOT track window size and aspect ratio across clones and at least one user has indicated that we should. I agree.

I rated seriousness as a 'major irritation' because I can imagine what a pain it is if you go to some trouble to get a window that is just the right size and aspect and then need to clone one or more (several times) that don't obey that same setting."

Karnig Mikaelian wanted to revolve a 2d plot into 3d. His mesh was a 2d curvilinear mesh that had a
single block with ghost zones all around it. When he revolved the plot he got the no data
message. This can be replicated with curv2d.silo. I think the problem is that because there
are ghost zones all around all the geometry is removed by the facelist filter.

I got around this by doing threshold operator to the 2d data and saving that out as a vtk
file, reading that back in and then doing the revolve.

There should be a better way. Either make visit smarter or add an operator that allows the
ghost zones to be stripped before doing the revolve."

Hello, I'd like to report a problem I've been running into with memory 
use when visualizing large point data.  The problem occurs when looking 
at a molecule plot with a clip operator (I'm pretty sure it happens with 
other types of plots too, but this is what I've looked at the most).  
Every time the clip plane is modified, each engine_par process grabs 
about 100MB of memory. 

I have recreated the problem using the galaxy example data (much 
smaller), to make sure it isn't a problem with our data reader plugin.  
To get a decent sized data set, I modified galaxy.C to set NPOINTS to 
150000 (any more than that seems to make the galaxy executable 
segfault).  I then open galaxy0000.silo, and create two molecule plots 
(again to increase dataset size), and a clipping plane operator.  Then, 
every time I change the clipping plane, each engine_par process grabs 
another 5-10MB.  This isn't so bad since the data size is still 
relatively small, but it's easy to run out of memory this way with large 
datasets.

I have tried both svn trunk from several months ago, and the 2.0 rc 
branch as of this morning, and they both have the same problem."

Not sure if many people know this but VisIt can handle SR mode from multiple engines.

However, when it does and you do save windows, it winds up getting annotations wrong. Annotations from plots on one engine wind up getting drawn on top of annotations from plots on another engine.

Annotations were handled 'strangely' when SR mode was first introduced. So, they sometimes get handled on the engine and sometimes on the viewer. When saving a window in non-screen-capture mode, the engine handles annotations. When handling an SR render to update the viewer's window, the engine does NOT handle annotations.

For the multi-engine case, only the viewer has enough knowledge to handle them correctly I think. No single engine does, right? I mean if there are two PC plots, one each from engine A and B, the fact that one plot's legend must appear 'lower' in the viewer window than the other is not known by either engine.

But during a save window, the engine is supposed to render everything including the annotations. So, this is a problematic case."

The SAMRAI folks are beginning work on their own MIR algorithms which they will be using within their code. They'll need to debug it and would like to visualize the MIR as they computed it, not as VisIt would.

There are multiple approache here. Some involve exchange of code that computes the MIR. Another approach is to allow for the pre-computed MIR to be stored to the database. This might be possible without modifying Silo. Here is the basic idea.

The original mesh is simply a zoo of elements (for QuadMesh's its a zoo of size 1). The pre-computed MIR has the effect of NOT changing any elements that are clean and introducing a tiny zoo of elements on any elements that are mixing. In theory, a data-producer could make a UCD mesh (or several of them) consiting of the union of all the new elements introduced by MIR. It would be a funny mesh in that it would be approx 1 original-mesh-zone thick and wind around the 3D volume following the MIR boundaries. But it would nonetheless be an object Silo currently supports. The only additional bit of information that might be useful is to define a UCDVar on the MIR mesh that identified the original-mesh-zone id from which the newly introduced zones come from.

Given this information in the file, VisIt would then offer an option of either computing its own MIR or using the one thats there."

visit -diff was designed with a basic assmption that two databases have identical structure. This need not be the case and when it is not, visit -diff is useless.

However, this can be easily fixed by adding some conditional code within visit -diff (using the Python callable method) to call user-defined .py code in a separate file passed to visit -diff which does following...

a) Given a variable name in the 'left' database generates the
   equivalent variable name in the 'right' database (or null
   indicating none exists).
b) Defines additional expressions on the right database.

This could be achieved pretty easily by defining two symbols...

The e-mail from Justin (luitjens@cs.utah.edu):

Hi,

I have a suggestion for how to improve the bounding box navigation
feature.  Currently the bounding box appears only at the bounds of
your data.  It would be nice if there was a second navigation box
that was scaled within your viewer.  A problem with the current
bounding box system exists when you are zoomed in on your data
to the point that you can no longer see the bounds of the domain.
At this point bounding box navigation is no longer useful as you
cannot see the bounding box and cannot know how far you have translated,rotated, or zoomed in.  If there were a second box that
was scaled according to the viewer this navigation method would
still be useful.  My idea is that reguardless of your rotation, zoom
level, or translation the box would always start at the same place
in the viewer and then as you do you motions it would move.  If
you finished a motion and then did another motion the box would
start back in the default position (relative to the viewer). 
If this already exists could you please tell me how to do this?

Thanks,
Justin

portions of the tranform matrix and then manipulating that. If the user
pans, zooms or rotates, then apply those deltas to the real matrix.

With large, large point meshes, it can be the case that many points in the mesh map to same pixel in image. I believe our current rendering technique results in a 'last writer wins' for color of whole pixel. This yields poor results if the point mesh is such that most of the points at the 'end' of the series of points in the mesh have some unique property such as a variable that is defined there is substantially lower than all other points.

A solution here is to at least 'randomize' the order in which points are rendered from the point mesh such that any properties (variables) on the points are also randomized relative to their render order.

Another solution might be to use point cloud rendering code (GPL licensed), here...

I belive we have discussed this issue before, but a quick search of clearquest left me empty handed. Here is the issue as reported by Matt O'Brien.

=========
We save particle position and direction in 3D Cartesian space, but we run lots of 2D cylindrical (r,z) problems.

So we plot the mesh and materials in 2D, and apply the ""Project"" operator to plot fields defined on the particles.

But the ""Project"" operator gives the wrong picture when we plot the velocity vectors.   A straight line vector in 3D does not become a straight line vector under a 2D (r,z) cylindrical projection.
It is a curved hyperbola.  But visit is showing a straight line in 2D.

Is it possible to enhance visit to correctly plot a 2D cylindrical projection of a vector?

1) I use the Mac OSX version.  In order to make it work, I needed help from the mailing list.  Starting Visit requires starting it from the Terminal application.  I know in the Unix world, this is the standard procedure.  However, on a Mac, this is a very foreign concept to many users.  I know of no other application that needs to start this way.  Chapter 3 of of Getting Started PDF shows how to start on Unix and Windows, please add a subsection on how to start on a Mac with very detailed instructions on where the Terminal application is located, how to change directories, and how to launch VisIT.


2) I work with a program that supports Byte (1byte), INT (2 bytes) and Long INT (4 bytes).  The Getting Data Into visit PDF has a good section on brick of values (BOV) files.  For the example header in section 3.1 please add a comment how many bytes each of the 4 data types expects."

It would be nice to be able to use the scatter plot to do a 'phase plot'. Suppose we have time varying voltage and current measured  from a circuit. A phase plot of voltage vs. current might look like an ellipse.

However, scatter plot is enabled ONLY when there are multiple variables ON THE SAME MESH. Scatter plot plots variables ONLY from the same mesh.

Since curves in VisIt don't really have a 'mesh' that they live on (each curve defines its own mesh), we can't ever scatter plot curve variables. We ought to be able to though."

This is related to 8959.

Our scatter plot does not generate actual paths in 'phase space' even if the input data is 'phase related'. All you get is a bunch of points. I think when the numbers of points are low as in curve data (see 8959), we ought to have the option of 'drawing lines between points known to be neighbors in the input mesh'. I think this option would be useful even for 2 and 3D rect and unstructured grids of moderate size. Yes, you would get what appears to be inter-tangled lines, but the trend the lines would suggest might be more useful than just the dots themselves."

this is a feature request but I don't know how hard it is to implement:

It would be very nice if the Vector plot would allow specifying
different variables for scale, orientation and color of the vectors.
Currently I think what happens is the magnitude of the vector variable
is used for both scale and color.

A second, slightly related feature that would be useful for us:
Having a choice of glyphs that are oriented, scaled and colored instead
of only arrows (for example a circle or ellipse). This would allow
plotting a number of vector fields and easily distinguishing between
them."

The data contains some new fangled Mili data that I don't think our Mili reader was originally written to support. Bob Corey even said it is kind of a rare thing in Mili; time history data.

To aid in development, Bob provided two copies of the same database, one as 'time history' (m_plot stuff) and one as 'normal' (m_tht stuff).

There is also another tarfile there containing some data for a ship that is done in the 'time history' way too."

Closing a database used to be buried down in 1-2 levels of cascading menus and so was not used very often, if at all. Now, its right at the top. But, I often have problems closing a database. VisIt tells me it can't close a database with plots still up. So, then I have to hunt through the list of plots to find those from the database I want to close and delete them.

A user requested that it would be nice if hitting the close button presented the user with three options...
   a) delete all plots and close WITHOUT saving a session
   b) delete all plots and close AND save a session
   c) cancel
Or, perhaps the interface would just put up a dialog saying, ""in order to close this database, VisIt is about to delete all plots associated with THIS database. Would you like to save a sesssion first?""

[Updated by Cyrus Harrison]

I think we should warn them that closing the database will delete all plots using the database & prompt them to continue - not sure we need to add an option to save the save session into the mix. If they want to save the session they can 'cancel' the close & save the session before closing the database.

[Updated by Mark Miller]


If we're going to add an extra step at all (e.g. as in Cyrus' suggestion a warn-and-continue dialog), I am not sure I see any value in NOT providing a 'save session' option there on the same dialog. I mean, at the very least you would want some text there saying something like 'Hey, you have plots from this database in the plot list. Closing the database means they are all going to be deleted. If you want to be able to re-create them later, consider saving the session' and once you've gone that far, having a button there to actual do the save isn't a big leap.

[Updated by Mark Miller]



Maybe it makes sense to offer the 'save session' option ONLY in the case that ALL the plots would wind up being deleted. In that case, that is essentially the whole session.

[Updated by Cyrus Harrison]


Adding the option to save the session is there to help them recover if they accidentally delete plots correct? Why isn't warning them that this is about to happen sufficient? Maybe we can list the plots that are about to be axed to thoroughly communicate to the user what is about to happen.

It seems clearer to just say: Closing 'zzzz' database will result in deleting plots (1,2,3,...) - are you sure you want to do this?

Instead of: Do you really want to delete plots used by this database & do you want to save an session just in case you don't understand that you are about to delete plots used by this database?

-Cyrus

[Updated by Mark Miller] 

Ok, here is my own experience. I have plots up. I want to close a database for one reason or another. I never remember that I have to delete all its plots first. I just try to close it. I get a message saying 'you have to delete plots first'. I hunt through the plot list deleting all the (relevant) plots. I then close the database. I am sure almost any (novice) user will have the same experience, multiple times in fact. I think that behavior is problematic. What would be better?

Just quietly delete all the plots and close the database. Well, thats not necessarily a good thing if a person did NOT want to delete those plots and did NOT releaize that closing a database would have that effect. So, just quietly deleting them is probably bad. So, just warn them with an option to 'continue' or 'cancel'. I think thats Cyrus' suggestion.

Well, why is the person closing the database? If the attempt to close is solely to close and NOT part of some larger close and open again later scenario, then 'continue' and 'cancel' I think are sufficient. However, if the attempt to close is part of some larger sequence of operations to close now, open again later and see the same plots again (note, this is apparently a common situation on windows where re-open is totally useless see #41), then having the additional option to 'save session' is useful. Perhaps it is most useful when the ONLY plots that are in the plot list are from the same database though.

[Updated by Cyrus Harrison]

It sounds like there is an orthogonal issue with windows we need to solve. I am not sure if it is easily solvable, but I don't think we should conflate closing a database (and deleting its plots) with the more specific use case of closing a database as means to reopen it & recreate the existing plots as work around for a specific platform.

Ed Kokko would like a way to group his variables in his .mili file.
Hi use-case is to declutter the variable windows and make variables 
easier to find.

Couple of suggestions:
1)  Allow user to modify .mili file, prepending group names to variables, eg
   group1/var1
   group1/var2
   group2/subgroup1/var3

   Then have VisIt's Mili reader parse these 'grouped' variables correctly when
accessing the database.

2)  Modify makemili to allow user to specify variable 'aliases' that can be
parsed correctly in the Reader.

I think #1 might be easy to implement, only if the Mili files don't already
support variables with ""/"".

When we export to Silo, we get one file per MPI task in VisIt. It would be nice to be able to allow the user to choose the number of files produced much like Ale3d currently writes its restart/plot dumps. Silo libs' pmpio macros may be useful in this.

If we don't provide this option to 'collect' domains in common files, we may want to at least provide a means to 'throttle' number of MPI tasks writing files at any one time so that we ensure we don't overwhelm filesystem and wind up with much poorer performance for large numbers of MPI tasks writing files. This throttling could be handled in VisIt proper

Is there a way to assign default colors to Filled Boundary plots from silo

In my high fidelity sandwich simulations, I want my RoastBeef material to
always be red and my Turkey material to always be yellow.

Ideally, I'd like to put a lookup table in my home directory or to alias
""visit"" to a command that will preread the lookup table.

Thanks!

-Chris

Our current approach allows us to save a list of colors, but the materials must match by index.

Chris wants to be able to set specific colors for each material via name, to avoid issues that arise when using different materials (or material orderings) between simulations.

When you first connect to a machine via ssh, it asks you if the identity of the machine is OK.
You need to answer ""yes"" to complete the connection. 

W/ our qtssh.exe - we can capture the password, but there is no way answer ""yes"".

This make seem like minor problem - connect once elsewhere (say using linux), type yes & you should be OK. 

But due to how our host profiles are setup, I think it can trip up a large set of users, here is why:

The user had connected to rzzeus before, but our host profile uses ""rzzeus.llnl.gov"" as the host name - which requires another ""yes"".

After Brad & I figured this out, I told the user to use linux, to ssh to the rzgw & then ssh to ""rzzeus.llnl.gov"". He answered ""yes"" and w/ this response was stored. After this point everything worked fine on windows. 

They reasons why this is tricky:
* Users aren't likely to append the "".llnl.gov"", unless they know that resolves the issue. 
* We (developers) aren't to see it b/c we already answered ""yes"" to most combos of hosts.

 I have particle energies that range from 1e-6 to 10ish, and I want to have about 5 histogram bins in each decade (power of 10).  Like 5 bins for [1e-6, 1e-5], another 5 bins for [1e-5, 1e-4] and so on for each power of 10.  Can it do something like that?

 Thanks.

This happens b/c quads are split into two triangles by OpenGL & the bi-linear interpolation we want isn't realized. 


There have been a few attempts to resolve this:
*Subdivide quads operator
 It doesn't avoid the fundamental splitting issue, and its defaults are targed a very large quads. This makes it very hard for users to try.
*Splitting to four triangles 
 Still isn't high enough fidelity, for a symmetric dataset, can make everything look hashy.

I think the only solution is a shader strategy that splits quads into two tris, but provides all of the quad info so the proper interpolation can be done. This should be prototyped outside of VTK. Adding it to VTK is going to be quite difficult :-(.
