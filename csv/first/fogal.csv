The code for this is in @common/proxy/RemoteProxyBase.C@:

<pre>
if(!launch->GetXDisplay().empty())
{
    AddArgument(""-display"");
    AddArgument(launch->GetXDisplay());
}
</pre>

so it looks like @GetXDisplay@ is returning an empty string even when the string is set in the GUI.  This probably means that changing it in the GUI is not properly setting the string in the first place.

Workaround is to just add it to the 'custom args' box we have."

   http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=10778&nbn=1

but our users are getting bit by it, so it'd be nice if we could find some kind of workaround.

As a summary of the problem, FindMPI looks for ""-l"" options on the command line needed for MPI programs.  However some systems end up with default compilers of, say ""x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++"".  The regex logic in the module picks up on the ""-linux-gnu-g++"" part, and tries to add it as a link option... which is of course garbage.

There's a CMake patch available to fix this:

  http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-util/cmake/files/cmake-2.8.1-mpi.patch?view=markup

We could apply the patch as we build CMake, as one solution.  Is there a way we can clone FindMPI in our tree and apply the patch there, though?  That'd be nicer because it'd allow an external cmake install to be used."
