418,Resolved,VisIt,Bug,High,ThreeSlice crashes on MIR data if one material is disabled and there are blocks that are completely turned off,Jeremy Meredith,"",2.1.1,Gunther Weber,10/07/2010,"",0,"",10/07/2010 07:00 pm,10/08/2010 05:44 pm,5 - Always,4 - Crash / Wrong Results,trunk,"","",All,DOE/SciDAC,"An APDEC/ANAG user encountered a problem with using the ThreeSlice operator together with material interface reconstruction. As soon as he turned of one of the materials, the VisIt engine will crash.

Due to its size, I cannot upload the file. It is available at /project/projectdirs/visit/plot.nx128.step0000375.3d.hdf5.gz on NERSC machines.

Reproducing the problem:
- Open dataset
- Create Pseudocolor plot of any variable (e.g. ""temperature-fluid"")
- Add ThreeSlice operator
- Go to material selection, disable mat2
- Draw plot
-> Engine crashes

Additional information:
- At least once, the crash seemed to occur when a GetCell call on a vtkDataSet return 0 as result (even though GetNumberOfCells returned a value different from zero)
- Using the ""-dump"" option, I did get data sets with point data but with no ""CELLS"" keyword/information. These data sets seemed to correspond to domains that are comprised entirely of the material that is turned off.
-> This leads me to believe that it may be related to optimizations we added for handling domains in a data set that are comprised entirely of a single material.

I found the problem both in 2.0.1 and the current trunk. I also reproduced the problem on Linux (64bit) and MacOS (10.6-64bit).

Estimate: 6 weeks. Is this our chance to fix general t-junction problem at coarse/fine level boundaries? Estimate: 3 months)

According to Cyrus, this error is due to how the expression parser caches variable names and does not take non-variable arguments into account.

To reproduce use the following script:

OpenDatabase(""data/noise.silo"")
DefineScalarExpression(""comp0"", ""array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 0)"")
DefineScalarExpression(""comp1"", ""array_decompose(grad_tensor_diagonal, 1)"")

DefineScalarExpression(""sum1"", ""comp0 + comp1"")
DefineScalarExpression(""test"", ""2*comp0"")
DefineScalarExpression(""diff0"", ""abs(sum1-sum0)"")
DefineScalarExpression(""diff1"", ""test-sum0"")
AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""diff0"")

diff0 should be zero everywhere but it is not. diff1 should differ from zero, but is currently evaluating to constant zero.

As far as I can tell the failure is due to ghost zone generation not being implemented for arrays causing ""component_0"" to ""disappear"" when an operator or plot requests ghost zone generation.
