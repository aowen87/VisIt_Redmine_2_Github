We must be doing some drive-related funny-business that's making this not work. Perhaps the problem is only browsing the files in the mdserver since we pass down a string for filenames.

VisIt has logic to detect 1D quadmeshes and re-interpret them as curves. However, it requires the quadmeshes also be single block.

By removing that logic and allowing a avtCurveMetaData to haven blocks, I've tested this and it works with very minor changes to VisIt internals.

The curve plot behaves strangely when domains are removed in the middle because it winds up connecting the dots across gaps in the curve that would otherwise exist due to domain removal. Removing domains from the ""ends"" of the curve plot works fine.

What should a subset plot of a multi-block curve look like? One idea I had was a banded colored background of the curve plot or a horizontally colored line.

Supporting a multi-block curve object simplifies data producers whose curve data is distributed across multiple MPI ranks.

OTOH, it is very apparent that ""curves"" should not demand as much special handling in Visit as we have for them and we'd be much better off just dealing with them like any other (rectilinear) qualmish except that they are 1D topologically and spatially. If we wound up modifying VisIt everywhere to do that, then this simple fix for curves is not necessary."

Here is how I can reproduce the issue:

- The source data is a csv file with three columns that correspond to x_coordinate, y_coordinate and a value.
- I open the csv file using the Plaintext reader. I DO NOT use the option to specify columns 0 and 1 as the x and y coordinates.
- I then create an expression called 'unnamed1' with Definition 'var02'. This will be used for thresholding.
- I create a scatter plot using var00 and var01 as x and y, and var02 as the Color Variable.
- I then apply a threshold operator using the scalar 'unnamed1'.
- When applying the threshold operator, there is an option to output mesh as 'Zones from input' or 'Point mesh'.
  - When using the 'Zones from input' option, the threshold operator outputs weird results.
  - Changing the output to 'Point mesh' gives expected results.

When opening the file, if I use the options of the Plaintext reader to specify that columns 0 and 1 are the x and y coordinates, VisIt creates a point mesh and the thresholding works fine with both threshold output options ('Zones from input' or 'Point mesh').

- I have created a simple .csv file and .session file that reproduces the issue.
- The .session file contains two plots, one that thresholds using 'Zones from input' the other using 'Point mesh'.
- The thresholded plots are different


Having to tick the 'Point Mesh' button in the threshold dialog is not a big deal, but I have encountered some plots where the incorrect method has been used without realising that the output was wrong."

I have found a bug in Visit (2.12.3) with Silo files in a time sequence.
I am attaching two time states with (parallel: 2 files per time step + 1 header--> 6 silo files total).

These are generated using Libsim.

There are two issues (after loading both time states: pseudocolor->rho): 
1.) When you move to the second time step, the surface is not completely rendered. 
     If you hit Reopen and Draw, the surface fully appears.

2.) If you Reopened on the second time step, then go back to the first time step, an error throws:
Pseudocolor: ()
viewer: Tried to access 97 of 97.

These two issues are quite common (particularly the second one) with the Silo extracts from Libsim.

The problem is that the plugin summarily populates database metadata without regard for whether the file open actually succeeded. If it conditioned the population of metadata on a successful file open, then it could return _empty_ metadata in cases where the file is not a ProtienDatabank file and VisIt would recognize that the plugin is probably not the right one to use for the given file (even though the extensions matched).

Next, even a GetMesh call succeeds and returns NULL from this plugin.

This behavior had us convinced the file was indeed a ProteinDatabank file even though later analysis proved that it wasn't.

Normally VisIt always displays the whole zone values unless some material selection is being performed. If there are no materials being selected there is a setting that forces material interface reconstruction and allows seeing the per material values. Neither of these mechanisms appear to be working. I couldn't verify this since none of our test data sets appear to have per material values for variables (or at least none that I could find). The first step is to modify the curv2d.silo generator to put out material specific values for the density that are markedly different so that we can test this. Then we should get this working.

    Maybe this has come across someone who can give me a pointer in the right direction.
    
    The „behavior“ is somewhat obscure:
    
    I’m on osx (10.13) with a recent (svn) version of visit.
    I can open sources and add plots.
    But the render/viewer window stays blank _until_ I resize the window, or change the screen (3-finger left-right swipe) and back.
    If I manipulate (e.g. rotate) the plot, the viewer/render window is not updated until I resize the window or change the screen.
    This is somewhat mildly annoying.
    
    I had a look in vtkqt and the ViewerWindow but was not able to find the culprit for this behavior.
    I suspect it has something to do with the vtkRenderWindow.

The solution was to add --no-openssl to Qt build. But, we don't wanna do that in general. Only when its absolutely necessary. This is because SeedMe needs it. Currently, SeedMe is not a bonafied build_visit package and is instead a sub-package in python build. So, build_visit really has no knowledge about whether it is or is NOT being requested in a build. So, there is no way to condition --no-openssl in Qt on basis of SeedMe. When python packages are promoted to fully first class packages in build_visit, then we could do business that way.

The solution here may be to just add an env. variable such as DO_QT_OPENSSL that a build_visit invoker can set to control this.

Below is the patch that our users came up with to bv_qt.sh to get things to build on Fedora.

This file is written by starccm code.  So far, I haven't had any

difference that I know is that there are several parts (here

So I wondered if anyone has any solution to this issue. I would be 
happy to sent you the file in case it is required.

Note that a key part of Engineering users interaction with VisIt is through a python script they have developed called _GrizIt_. The python _GrizIt_ script is designed to allow engineering users to use Griz commands they are familiar with to interact with VisIt.

VisIt's notion of _global_ node and zone ids is confined to a 1-tuple of arbitrary (but typically 32 or 64 bit integral) type. We need to generalize this notion to an n-tuple of arbitrary types. In the conext of Mili, _n_ would be 2. The first component would be a Mili class id, super class or class name (as strings) and the second component would be the number of the element in that collection.

Note that this impacts several spots in the GUI where users have the option of typing in _global_ ids. My suggestion, to make this modification simple, is to simply enhance these text box entries to support space, comma, semicolon and tab delimited values. The first value would be interpreted as the first component of the n-tuple, the 2nd value for the second component, etc. Finally, searches within mesh datastructures to find the node/zone specified by the n-tuple also would need to be enhanced to deal with multi-component matching.

Its concievable that one might want a 2-tuple consisting of a 'char' for the first component and an 'int' for the second. If that proves to be problematic however, its probably ok to assume all components of the n-tuple are the same type."

Another possibility is that a sequence of gui gestures to pick zones or nodes is packaged up to create a _pick group_.

We may want to maintan a stack of recently entered pick strings that represents each group of picks and which can be easily toggled on/off or deleted. On the other hand, a simple toggle may be sufficient here to turn on and off picked/selected nodes/zones. Otherwise, next to the text box where the string specifying the picked/selected zones we could have two buttons, one to use the string to pick/select, the other to use the string to UNpick/UNselect."

We wrote this plugin years ago in an attempt to integrate data from one of our solvers with VisIt.  Since then we have significantly expanded our suite of solvers (and added new data formats), and have standardized on another approach to VisIt interoperability.  We instead translate all of our data to VTK unstructured grids before sending data to VisIt.

We no longer use or maintain the VCellMTMD plugin.  Sorry, I should have informed you earlier so you don't waste time maintaining VCellMTMD.

We have also embraced the VisIt/pyside integration and deploy our VisIt capability as a QT application launched from VCell.​  This capability is currently pre-release quality, but we plan to bring it to production soon.  As you likely know, Kathleen resolved our inquiry about pyside support in Windows by including a fix in VisIt 2.12.1.  This worked for our VisIt/pyside application in WIndows 7 but still crashes under Windows 10.

I verified missing module by inspecting the following paths on builds 
Linux: visit/2.12.X/linux-x86_64/lib/python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

Apparently, things are going fine through the NETCDF library and then when trying to call NC_var_shape, the mdserver crashes. The reported crash is inside libmfhdf.dylib, which is an HDF4 shared library! That file is defining some NETCDF functions!!! IT seems to me that HDF4 should not be defining HDF4 functions. Also, we don't link the Exodus or NETCDF readers with HDF4. IF we load any HDF4 plugins (like Enzo or ZeusMP) then the NC_var_shape from HDF4 is being called instead of the symbol from libnetcdf.6.dylib.

Maybe libmfhdf could be patched in build_visit so it does not define NETCDF symbols.

I have been working on implementing HDF5 with XDMF as the new I/O for the code I use. I believe I have came across a bug in the VisIt XDMF Plug-in but I could be wrong.



Whenever a dimension of the data in the attribute matches the last dimension of the mesh in the grid it is on, VisIt views the attribute as an array. As an example, I have recreated the issue using explicit values given in XML, however this is the same issue as when I point to HDF5 datasets. In the below example (attached as well) the Attribute ""U"" is seen as an array in VisIt, since the last dimension of the mesh grid it is on, 9, is also a dimension of the Attribute. When this dimension matching does not occur however, everything works as expected, as in for the ""V"" attribute. 



I believe this is an issue in the VisIt plug-in because I could not cause this issue in p*r*view. I have used VisIt 2.9 and VisIt 2.7 and the same issue was present. If anyone has encountered this issue before or has an idea how to fix it, it would be greatly appreciated. Below is the example XDMF file that causes the error and the file information from VisIt.

Hi Eric,

I’ve noticed what may be a bug in the latest version of Visit.  When you click on the pick option to get values at specific nodal coordinates, in the window that pops up there is an option to increase the maximum number of tabs (default is 8).  However, when I try to increase this number past 8, the number of tabs visible does not increase.  For example, if I set it to 15, I still only see 8 tabs (see below screenshot).  However, I can select 15 different points before the tabs start being overwritten.  In the previous version of Visit 15 tabs would appear at the top so I could see the values of all my picks.

Is there a way to open an older version of Visit on the LC?  I was looking through /usr/gapps/visit/, but there doesn’t seem to be an equivalent “frontendlauncher” executable for the old versions as is present for the current version.  Please advise.

Thank you,
Rishi

Subject: [visit-users] Small bug in VisIt's eigenvector calculation 
 
Hey,
We found a small bug (or inconsistency) in VisIt expression’s eignvector calculation.  The following is what we saw and two screenshots are included in the attached word document.  It’s easy to get around by manually reconstruct the vectors but it would be nice if this inconsistency can be fixed in the future.
 
Figure 1 shows the tensor plot of a stress tensor at an element and the corresponding label plot.  We define an expression eigenvector = eigenvector(StressTensor) and show the value through a label plot in Figure 2.  It looks like the three eigenvectors are the three columns. However, the online help for “Built-in expressions” says
eigenvector(expr)
expr must evaluate to a 3x3 tensor. The eigenvector expression returns the eigenvectors of the 3x3 matrix argument as a tensor (3x3 matrix) valued expression where each row in the tensor is one of the eigenvectors. Use the component index operator ('[]') to access individual eigenvectors.
Example: evecs = eigenvector(tensor), evecs[1]
 
Best wishes
Pengcheng

The GUI (and pan/zoom ops in the Viewer) can exhibit 10-20 second delays between adding plot and having it appear in the plot list, deleting a plot, hiding a plot, etc.

The shear number of items is part of the problem. Reducing the number of items can be improved somewhat...
* don't do automatic expresions (mesh quality, time derivative, vector magnitude). There are prefs. for these.
** Note: mesh quality exprs only get created for ucd meshes so that pref. has no effect on non-ucd mesh databases
* don't do operator-created expressions
** currently know pref. for this so need to add one
** We could adjust logic in operators to create operator exprs only when mesh or var count is low, say less than 50
* don't create subset plot entries for meshes of just one block. Thats pointless and easily corrected.
* We populate the menu in the viewer too. Do we really need to do that? An informal survey indicated several _developers_ weren't even aware of the option in the viewer's menu suggesting users are even less aware of this feature. I think it would be easiest/best to remove it entirely. Short of that, maybe it is never created until some user actually does the GUI actions to suggest its needed by right-clicking in the viewer, going to Plots and then trying to add a plot.

The above changes actually make things almost useable for seseame.pdb (an extreme example of a database with a large number of objects)

Next, we need to add smarts to not constantly create and destroy variable menus as frequently as we currently do. We enter VariableMenuPopulator a lot. It has some smarts to return early but I think we need to improve that. I think we should return early when the database and timestep are same since last visit. But, I don't think we do that. Furthermore, some of the logic there to determine early return is expensive (operator== on expression list iterates over all expressions). The order in which we consider each expression's members in an individual expression's operator== could have some impact too. For example, we should try to compare those attributes of expressions that are more likely to be different *first*. The operator[] on ExpressionList is a linear search. That can be fixed easily too. I've currently coded a simple hashing mechanism there and improved performance quite a bit.

We're also taking too much memory. The GUI process easily reaches 1 Gigabyte on sesame.pdb. Hacks for several of the obove changes demonstrate we can get that back down to something reasonable, maybe 250 Mb. However, I think the right long term answer is to switch to an on-demand form of menu creation where we keep a sort of dom object internally regarding what the full menu structure should look like but only realize the parts of that structure with the Qt widgets that are needed at any moment.

I rated impact as high but expected use as rare because I think it is rare we deal with databases with large numbers of objects."

The current eigenvector expression returns the vectors in a matrix, with individual eigenvectors in each column.

You would have to take the transpose of the result from the eigenvector function, and then use the [] operator on the transpose. Does the visit team think that this is a problem?
If so, is this going to be fixed?
If not, the documentation should be fixed. It would be bad to have someone chasing non-existent code bugs because of this.

The version of cmake we are using (3.0.2) provides a FindHDF5 with clunky logic that will fall back to always use h5cc if it's in your path.

bv_hdf5 was recently changed on the trunk to not install h5cc, so our build_visit hdf5 wasn't providing h5cc.

h5cc is in the default path on several platforms,  (including LLNL's LC platforms) so tpls using CMake's FindHDF5 support will always find the wrong hdf5 libs.


changing bv_hdf5 back to install everything fixes the problem  -- the cmake logic finds h5cc for our install and uses it.

I am thinking this is bad practice. You can imagine a time series where the size of an object like a point mesh grows and shrinks over time, maybe with some states having no points, and in those states, the object will not exist in the metadata, causing any plots or expressions involving it (that work fine at other timesteps) to fail."

I found some more problems with the build_visit script when trying to have Damaris installed. I listed the changes to make here. If you could commit the corrections for the next release (hopefully so that people attending the SC tutorial have a working version), it would be great:

- in the bv_support/bv_damaris.sh file, the DAMARIS_URL should be changed as follows:
export DAMARIS_URL=${DAMARIS_URL:-""https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/35204""}
- in the bv_support/bv_xercesc.sh file the XERCESC_URL should be changed as well as follows:
export XERCESC_URL=${XERCESC_URL:-""http://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/c/3/sources""}

Also when the build_visit script defaults to searching in the VisIt website for the third-party libraries, there are 2 issues:
- Xerces-C is missing, as pointed out in my previous mail. You can find it here: http://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.1.2.tar.gz
- XSD is missing, you can find it here: http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/xsd/4.0/xsd-4.0.0+dep.tar.bz2
- The archive damaris-1.0.1.tgz is incorrect, it contains damaris-1.0. So it should be replaced with https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/35204/damaris-1.0.1.tgz

I don't know if you have a policy behind hosting some third-party dependencies and not other, I see that boost is also no here. Here the problem is mainly with XercesC, which has changed location since the build_visit script was made. Hopefully it doesn't change anymore.

Thanks a lot!

The bug is in the file engine/main/XDisplay.C in function XDisplay::Initialize:
[...]
    //updated: enabling new logic
    if(!this->launch || (this->xserver = xinit(this->display, user_args)) == -1)
    //if(this->launch && (this->xserver = xinit(this->display, user_args)) == -1)
    {
      return false;

[...]

The ""new logic"" causes the function to fail if no X server should be launched or if the X server fails to launch. The ""old logic"" caused the function to fail if a X server should be launched and it fails.

So this function always fails when existing X servers should be used. This causes that no attempt is made to connect to the display server, see function Engine::SetupDisplay in engine/main/Engine.C. As a result, the parallel engine fails or falls back to software rendering.

My tests with the ""old logic"" were successful, so I propose to simply revoke the ""new logic"".

I've tried a few different files, generated both by CUBIT and exported from libMesh. I've verified that I can open the same files using VisIt 2.10.3.

Since viewercore relies on some AVT stuff and was destined for the viewer, it ends up linking with some _ser avt libraries. When viewercore is linked into the parallel simV2runtime_par library, it brings along its _ser dependencies, even though we really want only the _par versions of the avt libraries.

The best thing might be to build the viewercore sources directly into the simV2runtime libraries instead of linking with viewercore. This would permit us to use the _ser and _par libraries that we want explicitly. We could also omit files like ViewerFileServer and ViewerEngineManager, which are not needed by the simV2runtime, and have some _ser dependencies of their own due to libraries like engineproxy. Furthermore, by not using some of those classes, we could revert to not building libraries like mdserverrpc, mdserverproxy, launcherrpc, launcherproxy, when we're doing engine-only builds.

As things stand on the trunk, engine-only builds are broken because the simv2 runtimes can't be linked with viewercore, which is not built."

When we observe this signal and update a plot or operator's attributes, then we are going through the atts->Notify/UpdateWindow process more frequently than we should.

I suggest one simple change:
Turn off keyboard tracking for all QSpinBox instances (myspinbox->setKeyboardTracking(false)).  For typed input, this means the 'valueChanged' signal would not be emitted until return is pressed or the spinbox loses focus.

This helps for the case of typing input into a QSpinBox.  It doesn't help with the up/down arrows, and I'm not sure if this aspect should be addressed as well."

Likewise, VisIt knows about parallel and serial database engine targets. But, it doesn't know about parallel and serial TPL dependencies (at least I don't think it does).

A lot of other things can depend on HDF5 (netcdf, H5Part, Xdmf, etc., + many VisIt plugins). Can we get by with a single libhdf5.so installation that supports *both* serial and parallel (certainly, the HDF5 library is capable of that) or do we have to build two separate HDF5 installations, one with and the other without MPI dependence? Same question for libMOAB.

We have a bug in the MFEM/VisIt integration that prevents us from visualizing high-order Nedelec elements on tet meshes. 

Cyrus: the problem is in line 462 of VisIt’s src/databases/MFEM/avtMFEMFileFormat.C.

Can you switch
   mesh = new Mesh(imesh, 1, 1);
to
   mesh = new Mesh(imesh, 1, 1, false);

The fix_orientation argument is true by default in this constructor, because it makes sense when we use the mesh for discretization. For visualization, this is actually wrong in the high-order Nedelec case.

Hello,


I just joined this mailing list to post a VisIt bug I discovered the other day and it's fix. I would suggest creating a better medium for reporting bugs, as joining this mailing list (with two? administrative authorizations required) is quite cumbersome for someone who is not as much interested in developing VisIt, as just trying to be a good citizen. Yet this is all there is in the FAQs, and there is no guidance on the webpage in general about where to send bug reports.


On to the issue.


Operating System: This bug only effects Windows machines, and I've only tested it on Windows 10 using Windows Power Shell.


Version: VisIt 2.10.20, Python 2.7


Issue: VisIt fails to launch in the system's Python when any arguments are passed to visit.exe.


Steps to reproduce:
Run in python the following lines:
import sys
sys.path.append(<path-to-VisIt-site-packages>)
import visit
visit.AddArgument(<any-argument-you-like>)
visit.Launch()  # this will fail


this also fails, since it essentially just adds the '-nowin' option:
import sys
sys.path.append(<path-to-VisIt-site-packages>)
import visit
visit.LaunchNowin() # this will fail


Reason: 
__read_visit_env in frontend.py in lib/site-packages/visit is not correctly parsing command line arguments on Windows. This may date back to Brad Whitlock's fix in 2013 (according to the comments at the top of the module)? The issue seems to be that Windows reads [""visit.exe -my -args -here"",""-env""] as a program called ""visit.exe -my -args -here"" which takes in one argument, ""-env"". Then it dies because it cannot find a program called ""visit.exe -my -args -here"".


Fix:
Since the string with ""visit.exe"" and the arguments other than ""-env"" comes from __visit_cmd and works fine on Unix, the best thing is probably just to parse that string at the moment we are tacking on ""-env"" and creating a list, creating instead a list where ""visit.exe"" and each argument are separate items.

Change line 250, which currently reads ""pcmd = [vcmd, ""-env""]"" to the following:
pcmd = vcmd.strip().split(' ') # please note there is a space between the quotations!
pcmd.append(""-env"")


I've tested this fix on my machine, and the issue seems to be resolved. I haven't been able to test it in earlier versions of Python or Windows, but the Python docs for the Popen constructor (2.6 is the earliest docs I can find) seem to suggest an argument format like the one I use to resolve the issue, so I would expect that this change would only increase stability and not affect other environments.


Thanks!
Christopher Strickland

One more request for the next VisIt release :)

I might have mentioned this previously, but we rely on short URL links as the main way to track MFEM downloads. This is important for us during project reviews and when writing funding proposals.

Do you mind changing 

svn_bin/bv_support/bv_mfem.sh

to use our short URLs instead of directly grabbing the files from mfem.github.io/releases? This is what’s done for example in spack and homebrew/science:

https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/mfem/package.py
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pull/3530/commits/2a2549783607af45641c8c82540b26f383e3970a

I’ll be happy to send you the list of the short URLs for the different MFEM versions, or you can grab them directly from http://mfem.org/download.

Please let me know if we can be of any assistance with this. Thank you in advance for your help!

Hi all,

I'm currently compiling VisIt for use on Ubuntu 15.10 and I want to use the system python. It seems as though there is an improvement that can be made to the build_visit script so that it successfully finds the python library dir:

On line 14708, we can change:
    PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR=""${VISIT_PYTHON_DIR}/lib""
to:
    PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR=`""$PYTHON_CONFIG_COMMAND"" --configdir`

I believe this should be cross platform, but don't have other machines to test it with.

Cheers,

so I mentioned this before, but it’s getting to be a limitation on the work we’re trying to do. if we try to sample SPH data to a grid larger than ~200^3, the compute engine goes OOM. this seems to be a problem of allocating the entire lattice on all available processors, and since the processors share a single memory bank (for instance if you run 20 procs on rzalastor), this quickly grows out of bounds of available memory. I know kevin was at one point working on streamlining the operator to use less memory, but have you guys looked yet into completely redesigning the way the grid is handled in parallel? at the moment, just the particle data is partitioned, mapped to a local grid of the size of the entire domain, and then at the end, all local grids are summed together for the global grid.

Hi everyone,

I just want to mention, that 2.10.0 does not build static VisIts (at least not on BlueGene/Q)
(https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/2423)

The reason is the switch from HDF5 1.8.7 to 1.8.14.
HDF5 now requires dlopen(and friends) to compile.
You have to link any HDF5 application now with an additional ""-ldl"".

Example:
 SILO compiles if I change the lines beginning with 28865 in ""configure"" of SILO to
         LIBS=""-lhdf5 -lsz -ldl $LIBS""
      else
         LIBS=""-lhdf5 -ldl $LIBS""

On the HDF5 forum you can read:
 ""We introduced dynamical loading of the HDF5 filters in HDF5 1.8.11 and this library is required now.""

VisIt engine cannot connect back to viewer, if login-node is known by different names and IPs for external connections (clients) and internal connections (compute nodes).

The problem has been discussed on the ""VisIt - User Mailing List"" and Brad suggested a fix:
https://elist.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-users/2015-October/017961.html
This fix works perfect on the JUQUEEN and I hope it can become part of the official VisIt release.

It introduces the command line argument ""-socket-bridge-host"" to set the socket bridge host instead of using ""gethostname(""localhost"").

Attached you find the implementation in common/comm/LaunchService.C for VisIt version 2.9.2.
It works fine on the BlueGene/Q JUQUEEN at Juelich Research Centre in Germany.

I came across a problem using libsimV2+Fortran+visitgetenv().

It is about the line 427 in visitfortransimV2interface.c:
    sz = (len < *lenv) ? (sz - 1) : (*lenv - 1);

IMHO, it should look like this:
    sz = (len < *lenv) ? (len) : (sz - 1);


From Fortran I call visitgetenv() like this:
      character(len=4096) :: env
      integer :: env_len = 4096
      if (mpi_proc_id == 0) then
        ierr = visItGetEnv(env,env_len); CHKWARN1(ierr, VISIT_OKAY)
      end if  

Hence, it has to ensured, that the string written to env must not be larger than env_len.   
In  visitgetenv() the string to copy is 'src' and its length 'len'.

=> if 'len' is smaller than '*lenv', we can use memcpy to fill 'env'.
else we should not copy anything to 'env'.

This has to do with VisIt's handling of time varying metadata. By default, it assumes md is time INvariant. So, objects that appear and disappear in Silo files in a sequence present problems.

The solution is to sometimes write empty objects so that the objects are always there and just sometimes empty.

However, I still don't think a plot object expecting to be backed up by real data from a database is going to react correctly when it has data on some timesteps and not on others.

If we use conditional compilation logic to handle it, I would suggest we predicate that logic on whatever CMake provides for this. But, I don't know for sure if CMake handles it out of the box.

We currently use boost's cstdint.hpp header file that is in our third_party_builtin dir and I am not sure if that is the right way to handle it. First, it smears 'boost' references all over our code and I am not sure that is ok. I think cstdint.h header defines it too. I think <cstdint> defines it too but my OSX 10.8 system didn't have that header.

Various database plugins (and some others) have a dependency on Boost only because fixed size integer types such as “uint_32t” and “int8_t.” I believe we use boost/cstdint.hpp for that purpose mainly because Windows does not have a “stdint.h” in which these types are defined (both Linux and MacOS have that include file). Can we add a VisIt include file such as “VisItIntTypes.h” or similar that defines these types in a platform independent way? That way we could use that file instead of boost and make a large number of plugins independent of Boost.

Note from Matthieu (tarball is attached to this ticket)

Hi Cyrus,

Here is an archive with the files to add/modify in the VisIt SVN repository to get Damaris to be compiled along with VisIt. There is also a README file indicating what each file does or how it was modified from its original version.

Note: when using --tarball instead of SVN, Damaris will uncompress the VisIt tarball to find the libsim headers. When the script finally builds VisIt, the same folder will be uncompressed again (I see in the script that it doesn't check for an existing ""visit2.9.0"" folder, I don't know if it's intentional, so I left it as it is).

Let me know if you have any question and keep me posted on the integration!

Thanks,
Matthieu"

While stepping through with a debugger, I seemed to be spending a lot of time stepping through data trees, so I ran with -dump.

The first filter dumped (avtMissingDataFilter) shows the input avtDataTree to have three nodes, with a single leaf at node 2.   The single leaf is expected, but not the tree depth.  I would expect at most 2 nodes, the root and the leaf, though single-node seems optimal.  Somewhere between the reader and this filter, we create a tree 3-deep.  That seems wrong.

I looked at the dumped input/output avtDataTrees for every filter in my pipeline and discovered that avtFacelistFilter increased the depth by 1.  That also seems wrong.
The facelist filter was applied twice in my pipeline, so the extra depth became more noticeable.

Not sure how much of a performance hit we take because of this, but it slowed down my debugging session considerably.

2352,Resolved,VisIt,Feature,High,enahnce boxlib plugin to handle new headers,Gunther Weber,"",2.10,Mark Miller,08/05/2015,"",100,"",08/05/2015 04:08 pm,09/10/2015 12:40 pm,"","","",3 - Medium,3 - Occasional,All,Any,"<pre>
I investigated this a bit more here at LBL talking to the BoxLib developers. There are different BoxLib file types, differentiated by the first line in “Header”. Most of the BoxLib files that I encountered are of type “HyperCLaw"" and that seems to be the type that VisIt expects. Andy Nonaka at CCSE has a copy of one of the files Mark Converse sent him. This is a file of type “CartGrid”, which seems to have additional information in it. VisIt completely ignores the first line of the file with the type. I assume when we were developing the reader in the first place, we did not have any access to “CartGrid” files so it did not make any difference.

However, if we want to read other BoxLib file types correctly, we need to read the first line and check the file type. The main difference between “HyperCLaw” and “CartGrid” files seems to be that they contain a “vfEps” (1e-08 in your file) per level between dx (the line ""0.05 0.05 0.05” in your file) and coordSys (the line “0” following the “1e-8” in your file). Removing this line (or these lines if there is more than one level), should allow VisIt to read the file until the reader is modified.

Actually it is not working.  I was on travel last week and was vpning in, using my mac laptop.  It was working on that.  But I just got back today, and tried it on my desktop and it doesn’t work.  I think  I am now having the same problems you were having (even after removing that line with the 1e-08).  I tried it on my laptop locally (so here in the office) and it also doesn’t work.  I even took it home to try while vpn from a remote location and it doesn’t work.  I have no idea why it was working last week and doesn’t work this week.  Any thoughts?

I removed that line as well, and I can open in Visit, then do a psuedocolor plot and draw a plot of that variable.  So at first blush it seems to be working.

Hi Mark,
  
I have debugged a bit more. IMHO, the problem is definitely with the Header file. The relevant section is below. . .
  
-2 -2 -2
2 2 2
  
((0,0,0) (79,79,79) (0,0,0))
100
0.05 0.05 0.05
1e-08
0
0
0 75 5.57623875809867e-06
100
  
Note the '1e-08' line.
  
VisIt's current plugin is expecting an integer there for the 'coordSys' data member of the Boxlib3D plugin. It reads as far as the '1' and sets coordSys int to 1. Then it attempts to read what it thinks is another 'integer' which I think is indicating if ghost zones are used. It tries to read the 'e-08' part via >> operator and that operation fails (i assume) or somehow the 'integer' value that gets set is '3'.
  
If I take out the 1e-08 line, neither boxlib nor VisIt crash anymore. However, I still don't get to a state where I can plot anything. The mdserver belives there are 75 blocks and a bunch of variables but VisIt's GUI menus are non-responsive.
  
I think somehow we're dealing with different file format versions.

It would make more sense to move filename and filter to the bottom of the window and make filter a combo box with just ""*.session"" in it. I liked the system dialog we were using to save session previously and would like to see the new one be a closer match for usability's sake.

2. The old behavior was to make a default filename that would be put into the file dialog in case the user wanted to just name the file ""visit1.session"" or whatever it made up. The new dialog just presents an empty filename and the widget does not have focus. I'd like the default added back in with the filename widget getting focus *and* the text in the filename line edit highlighted so the next character I type will override the whole filename."

Hi Mark,
I see what you mean, but that's not what I was thinking it would be like. My assumption is that it would maintain the limits during a session. I expected the limit would be reset at the end of the session and start from fresh for the next session. Mostly what I want is for the view to be maintained during a session. I don't care what happens after the session ends. Preserving that is what the save session feature is for.
-Kevin

Well, I checked 2.9.2 and current trunk and it would appear the behavior your describing also exists in those versions.

So, on to next question. Is this intentional?

I suspect it may be. I think if 'maintain view limits' is always enabled the question becomes what does that mean *across* VisIt startups?

Does it mean the view limits that were last in effect when VisIt was exited should be the same limits used when it is restarted? What happens if upon the next startup, the database being viewed is wholly different with different view extents, etc. 

I am not sure if this is a workable behavior in practice.

Can you maybe elaborate on why you would like 'maintain view limits' to always be on?

Mark

Hi VisIt Team,
I prefer the “Maintain View Limits” option to be checked on the advanced tab on the View Controls menu.  Unfortunately, pushing save options seems to not work in the case of this option.  Is this intentional?

Hi Eric,

The feature I'm requesting is to modify the XRay Query to write out the pathlength field separately from the emission field.  This will enable multi-group backlights to be imposed after the Query is run, so that users can study different backlighting strategies when designing experiments.  

For now, users can re-run the Query and supply different multigroup background intensities which is a decent work around.  

The detail of the feature request is as follows (based on the code in VisIt 2.9.1, avtXRayFilter::IntegrateLines(), 

Each zone has:
a : absoprtivity
e : emissivity

and we compute tmp[i] = exp( - a[i] * seqLength)   (for energy bin 'i')
tmp is the 'path length' through the zone (typically denoted by 'tau').   VisIt by default integrates intensities and accumulates them, for bin 'i':

radBins[i] *= tmp[i]    // attenuate incoming radiation by pathlength through current zone
radBins[i] += (1-tmp[i]) * e[i]/a[i]    // add in self emission of current zone

Instead, I propose we add a pathlengh array (per bin, just like radBins), and keep the total pathlength as well:
pathLength[i] += tmp[i]
radBins[i] = <same as before>

Then write both radBins and pathLength as separate binary outputs.  Perhaps this could be turned on only in raw-floats mode if you like."

I dug in for a while and the values in the texture coordinates all seem to be relative to linear plotting, with the color table shifted to log form.  When we put in textures on the order of <0.005, then the values all get mapped to the color at the bottom of the color table.  I believe this is because the resolution of the color table is such that most of the colors are being lost.

This does not happen with the vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper ... if you apply a Clip operator and change the data from rectilinear to polydata, the problem goes away.
Similarly, if you turn off 1D textures, the problem goes away as well.

GUIBase.C has helper functions that convert from double to QString and back again for use with LineEdits.

According to Qt 4.8 documentation, QString.setNum(double) by default uses 'g' format with precision of 6.
I think we should change our use of setNum for double to increase the precision, perhaps to 17?

Then ensure all GUI windows accepting doubles use the GUIBase helper methods: DoubleToQString (and variants),
and LineEditGetDouble (and variants).  This will help maintain consistency.

How about this alternative:
$ echo $PYTHON_LIBRARY|sed 's/.*\(python[^ ]*\).*/\1/g'
That is, strip everything from what PYTHON_LIBRARY contains except a string that starts with 'python' and ends with a space, excluding the space.

Hello,

Are there still known issues with the Exodus reader in versions 2.7.x and later?  I saw discussion earlier this summer about an updated Exodus reader plugin, but I am still seeing issues, and some of my collaborators at ARL are also having issues:

1 – Parallel Exodus files are not being loaded correctly in version 2.7.x and 2.8.  For some reason these newer versions of VisIt seem to be stacking the processor files serially, so that only the first of a set of parallelized files are actually being read in and plotted.  (v2.6.2 is still OK)

2 – Automatic file format recognition doesn’t work for parallel Exodus files – has never worked.  User must select Exodus manually.

3 – The Boundary and Filled Boundary plot types don’t work for some reason.  Perhaps materials or material volume fractions are not being recognized?  This also has never worked.

4 – Materials are not being recognized for turning on and off of subsets in a figure.  (May be related to 3 above.)

Thanks,

We do this by duplicating every vertex as many times as there are adjacent cells and simply outputting everything as if they were discontinuous fields. This used to work with the VTU reader up to VisIt 2.7.x but is apparently broken in 2.8.x. For example, the attached file simply consists of four squares with values 0...3 but it leads to the following error upon displaying the ""solution"" variable:

  The compute engine running on host down.math.tamu.edu issued the following warning: In domain 0, your nodal variable ""solution"" has 16 values, but it should have 9.  Some values were removed to ensure VisIt runs smoothly.

Not surprisingly, the output after removing nodal values is wrong as can be seen by comparing with the output produced by 2.7.x. Curiously, the same problem does not seem to happen with the corresponding VTK file (also attached).

Severity: Affects those among the several hundred deal.II users that use VisIt (~50%).

That was hackish to work around an issue with CharlesX output format.

I didn't think anyone would actually want duplicate nodes.

Turns out at least one customer wants duplicate nodes to handle discontinuous nodal fields.

Whats the right answer here. Allowing duplicate nodes for purposes of discontinuous nodal fields is a huge overkill and hurts VisIt performance internally immensely. It would be better if we allowed for discontinuous nodal fields. We could do this implicitly by adjusting logic checking for mesh node count and variable tuple counts and if they are not equal but the field's count is such that it is indicate of having a value as though each cell has its own unique (duplicate) nodes, then we can handle and render it as a discontinuous field.

Or, we can consider a different type of centering AVT_NODE_CENT_DISCONTINUOUS.

Or, we can add a feature to avtVarMetadata.

When parts of the enum scalar are turned off, the extents are changing. However, that apparently didn't used to happen when the same parts where turned off as a material.

So, I think the right answer is that somewhere in enum scalar selection, we need to decide NOT to change extents due to changes in the selection.

Now, I don't know if other use cases have a conflicting requirement; that extents should change when changes are made to an enum selection. I don't think that is the case as it would seem to be different than the way we handle selections for domains and materials, but maybe it is."

Greetings,

I have model output from SAMRAI that has about 130 million cells.  If I compute a histogram with 2 bins, it only shows about 16 million cells (maybe 2^24 ?) in each bin.  If I increase the number of bins so that no bin has more than 16 million entries, then it seems to count correctly.  I have reproduced this with the latest release (2.8.2) and a previous release (2.7).

This started in 2.8.2 because the order of args was swapped in frontendlauncher.py, adding '-forceversion' to the beginning of the list where before it was appended.

This causes a problem with visit_composite because it has specific expectations for its first argument.

A workaround:  modify visitmovietemplate.py to call 'visit_composite' instead of 'visit -composite' and change frontendlauncher.py to exclude 'visit_composite' from having '-forceversion' added to its command line (the way it is excluded from mpeg2encode).

Subject: [visit-users] quadratic cells: vector-plot

Hi all,

I would like to make a vector-plot of a nodal field defined on quadratic cells.

I have the components of the field in my database. But after defining an expression for the vector-field, I get the warning shown below - and no vector plot is generated.

--- warning ---

The compute engine ... issued the following warning: The data set has a quadratic element in it and this code to convert 2D elements to polydata is only capable of 1:1 cell to cell translation, whereas quadratic cells produce a 1:N translation. Please contact a VisIt developer to resolve this issue. ...

--- end of warning ---

Attached is an example exodusii-file containing 4 quadratic shell elements and one linear beam element. After reading in the expression ""U"", the vector plot is only showing the vector field defined on the nodes of the linear beam element - but not the vector field on the nodes of the quadratic shell elements.

Any ideas to resolve the issue?

However, what I am seeing with Spike's data is re-producible with some 2D test data.

Open arbpoly-zoohybrid.silo.
Plot mesh of 2D->mesh1_phzl
Plot label of same mesh and show both nodes and cells
Now, pick on zone 9. PIck returns correct zone number but only 3 nodes for this zone even though this is a 6-noded zone and the nodes are wrong.
Try picking on zone 6 too. You get correct zone number but incorrect node numbers. It returns a node, 26, that isn't even in the original mesh.

In helping to debug it, try doing a label plot of an expression of zonetype_label(2D->mesh1_phzl). It will show 'tri' for the 6 noded polygons.

Now, for the arbitrary polygons in this 2D mesh, the Silo plugin is reading those polygons but decomosing into triangles. It may not be appropriate to do this for 2D meshes any more as VTK appears to have decent support for arbitrary 2D shapes (e.g. polygons). In any event, the Silo plugin is doing much the same thing it does in 2D as it does in 3D with arbitrary shapes; decomposing those shapes into zoo-type shapes. The 2D dataset mentioned here is just a good way to test how VisIt is handling this and it appears to not be honoring the *original* mesh.

When VisIt performs a pick, I think it needs to know if the mesh has undergone some restructuring transformation (such as arb->zoo) and if so, then check if the picked zone is part of a zone that has undergone restructuring (not exactly sure how the Pick algorithm could know that though except to look at all its neighbor zones and ask if any have the same 'original' zone id. If they do, then Pick needs to go look at all the zones with the same original zone id, and collect the node ids from those. And, for those nodes, keep those whose original node id is appropriate (I don't know how we tag new nodes that are introduced for purposes of restructuring the mesh. I checked and it looks like Silo code tags avtOriginalNodeNumbers with the pair (domain-id, -1) so a negative 1 value for a avtOriginalNodeNumbers would inform Pick NOT to include that node in pick output.

I think arbitrary polyhedra are becomming more common and so I rated as occasional rather than rare."

I'm not able to provide an example in another format at this time.

It is caused by a long standing issue in avtStructuredDomainBoundaries which has been exposed by the enabling of the AMRStitchCell operator by default in 2.8. It can be worked around by using the -disable-ghosts-for-t-intersections command line flag and made to occur in VisIt 2.7.3 via -create-ghosts-for-t-intersections.

The actual bug is down to the SetExistence function not excluding RECIPENT_NEIGHBOR patches like SetNewBoundaryData does so some cells are incorrectly marked as existing. The same underlying routines are called to generate ghost cell data when carrying out contour plots and, although this has not been observed to be fatal, valgrind confirms that uninitialised memory is accessed.

I have a fix ready to commit (which continues to pass the operators/amr_stitch.py regression test) but unfortunately the SVN server appears to be down at the moment.

I discovered some oddities with curv2d, in that Pick will return different center than ZoneCenter, but even worse, OnionPeel will highlight a completely different cell. (I often use OnionPeel in conjunction with Pick as a sanity check.)

Here's a small script:
<pre>
OpenDatabase(silo_data_path(""curv2d.silo""))
AddPlot(""Mesh"", ""curvmesh2d"")
AddPlot(""Pseudocolor"", ""d"")
DrawPlots()
#do a pick before Onion peel

AddOperator(""OnionPeel"")
op = OnionPeelAttributes()
op.index = 482
SetOperatorOptions(op)
DrawPlots()

#Now dd a boundary plot, do the same pick, see if get same results.
AddPlot(""Boundary"", ""mat1"")
DrawPlots()
p2 = PickByZone(482)
if p2['point'] == p1['point']:
    print(""PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots yielded same point"")
else:
    print(""PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots DID NOT yield same point"")
SetQueryOutputToObject()
q = Query(""Zone Center"", element=482)
if (q['center'] == p1['point']):
    print ""ZoneCenter query returned same coords as Pick""
else:
    print ""ZoneCenter query returned different coords than Pick""

#Now feed the zone center as coordinates into a pick:
p3 = ZonePick(coord = q['center'])
print ""Pick using coord from Zone Center query returned zone: "", p3['zone_id']
</pre>

Here's the results:
PickByZone on Pseudcolor and Boundary plots yielded same point
ZoneCenter query returned different coords than Pick
Pick using coord from Zone Center query returned zone:  513

Now, if you Make the OnionPeel'd Pseudocolor plot active, and use the mouse to Pick on that zone, Pick will return zone '585'.
But we told OnionPeel to use zone '482'.

I think the difference is in the handling of ghosts, more specifically the 'AVT_HAS_GHOSTS' ghostType.

Hi Eric and John,

Thank you very much for spending so much time on this, and sorry for these strange legacy conventions. One of the many things on the to do list is to make this more sane. 

This mismatch can happen because BOUT++ adds guard cells in y for imposing boundary conditions. If a user collects all the data including guard cells (which is the default) then the output array will be larger than the input grid. The number of extra points will vary depending on the number of guard cells needed, which depends on the numerical schemes used. The number of extra points in y should always be even though: the same number added to each end.

I recommend checking if the y dimensions are consistent. If not, check that the solution file dimensions are larger than the grid file dimensions, and that the number of extra points is even. If not even then raise an error; if even then remove the same number of points from each side of the solution array.

Ixseps1 and ixseps2 determine the locations in x of the branch cuts, and are the number of grid points inside each of the two possible cuts. They can be set to zero or a negative number to mean that all points are outside the cut (and so non periodic), or a large number (which might be bigger than the number of grid points) to mean that all points are inside the cut (and so periodic). 
Zperiod should have a lower bound of 1, but an upper bound is tricky. Once it gets to around 50 you might want to print a warning, as it's unlikely to be physical. Not impossible though.

Thanks again

This was the original problem repoted by Jose.

<pre>
Jose Milovich was running client server and he wanted to export a database in VTK format.
He couldn't find the file after he saved it. It turned out when you select the directory
to store the file, it shows you the file system on the local machine and not the
remote machine (not surprisingly). He choose a directory that existed on the local
machine, but not on the remote machine so the file did not get saved. We should
either show the directory system on the remote machine or make it clear that it will
end up on the remote machine and not let the user browse the file system to select
the directory. Jose also thought that the default should be the same directory where
the data was located, not the users home directory on the remote machine.
</pre>

It turns out fixing this in general can be quite difficult involving reasoning backwards from the plot to be exported, which engine the plot is associated with, then the host that engine is running on, then bringing up a file browser remotely connected to that filesystem, etc.

But, something simple we can do is to prevent attempts to browse the filesystem when in client/server mode by graying out (disabling) the browse button. This will prevent users from being lulled into incorrectly thinking they are browsing the remote (engine) filesystem.

This target is supposed to allow building the simulation examples despite the flag being off.
On Windows, with visual studio, the all_simulations project is NOT part of the build, but all of the examples are, so they are built regardless. (I use Build Solution, not the ALL_BUILD target, I believe if the ALL_BUILD was used to build the solution, this may not happen).

I discovered this when I changed how PARALLEL settings are passed to the projects on windows:  the sim examples failed to build because I hadn't modified their CMakeLists.txt to account for the new PARALLEL handling. 

Upon investigation, adding 'EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD 1' to the sim examples target properties will prevent the examples from being built using 'Build Solution', but also prevents them from being built by attempting to build the 'all_simulations' target.  When this flag is set, the examples can only be built one at a time.  Not an ideal situation.

A possible solution:
in tools/DataManualExamples/CMakeLists.txt

IF(VISIT_DATA_MANUAL_EXAMPLES)
   # this is the current usage
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Simulations)
ELSE()
   # this will prevent the projects created in the Simulations directory from being added to the VisIt solution file.
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Simulations EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

Functions such as ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS() are getting called with parameters such as the one below

ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS(time_annotation ${VTK_DEFINITIONS}) 

where VTK_DEFINITIONS contains a list of compile time definitions (-D flags).

Unfortunately, it seems that by the time the function body of ADD_TARGET_DEFINITIONS executes only the first definition makes it to the body.

The definitions inside VTK_DEFINITIONS contain register overrides for VTK to dynamically load the appropriate subclasses. For example vtkRenderer is overridden to load vtkOpenGLRenderer. 

Without these definition overrides the default vtkRenderer::New() operation returns NULL. This had the side affect of causing the VisIt viewer to crash when support for modules like R are added to VTK. 

Needless to say this is really bad, and extremely difficult to diagnose.

Currently, I resolved this issue by passing ${VTK_DEFINITIONS} in quotes ""${VTK_DEFINITIONS}"", but I think we might need to find a better solution.

Also, it seems like we may need to ensure other functions or macros are not having similar truncation problems.

I have given you a file on the rz that demonstrates a bug in the visit
onion peel operator.

 It is a 3D polyhedral mesh (even though all the elements are really hexes).

If I plot

1. material filled boundary (ThreeD_Unstructured)
2. mesh (ThreeD_Unstructured)
3. subset of domains (ThreeD_Unstructured) (wireframe)

then apply operator to all plots

onion peel:
set: domain4
seed: 489
layers: 0

You will see that the material filled boundary plot gets the correct
zone, but the mesh and domain plot get the incorrect zone.

I think this is because visit in converting the hexes into 24 tets, so
the indexing is incorrect.

Our VTK reader instantiates the whole file contents into memory and then, I think, hangs onto *all* of it.
Reported by Ryan Vignes


When we read VTK, our reader instantiates the whole VTK object in the file into memory and *everything* in the file; every variable defined on the mesh. So, just *reading* the file to see what is in the file involves instantiating the whole 1Gigabyte object into memory. And, we do this on mdserver too!

For single part VTK files, Visit will use only one MPI task to process the data. Worse, however, is that it still winds up *reading* the file on all tasks!. So, for 16 processors, you don't get any speedup in terms of 16-way processing but you do wind up getting hit by a 16x memory consumption because the VTK file is istantiated into memory on every processor.

Doing a top while running on cab, I get the attached image for 16 processors and a single-part vtu file

Finally, if you'll notice in the attached 'top' image, one engine_par process is taking quite a bit more memory than the others. That is MPI rank 0, where all the work is actually being done by VisIt and I've moved forward several timesteps. And, there appears to be either a leak or some memory bloat we're not handling."
