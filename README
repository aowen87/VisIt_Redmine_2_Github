Some tools to help with migrating VisIt redmine tickets 
to github issues. Note that these scripts are specifically 
created to handle VisIt and were not created as general
migration scripts. Having said that, they should be fairly
customizeable with a little effort.  

Instructions:

    Within the msub_scripts directory, there are 4 scripts of importance.
    Note that many (maybe all) of these scripts could now be consolodated 
    into a single script. Since there hasn't been a need for it, it's been
    indefinitely put on a back burner. 
    Also, make sure you look over these scripts and understand them as they 
    really just launch python scripts with specific arguments that are 
    specific to the VisIt migration. 

    1. get_attachments.msub: this will retrieve the ticket attachments.
    2. get_comments.msub: this will retrieve the ticket comments. 
    3. get_redmine_tickets.msub: this will retrieve the ticket info. 
    4. migrate_tickets.msub: this will migrate all of tickets and their 
       comments to the target github repo. 


    The process:

    1. Fill out info in authentication_empty.py and change name to 
       authentication.py
    2. Lookover the msub scripts and update the arguments as needed. 
    3. Launch msub retrieval scripts to retrieve the info you need (at 
       the very least, the ticket info is required for a migration). 
    4. Launch the migrate_tickets.msub script. 
    5. Periodically look over the migration.out file to make sure 
       nothing is burning. 

    That's it!
